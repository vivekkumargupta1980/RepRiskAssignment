A boss accused of offering to promote two female colleagues if they had a threesome with him said complaining was futile because he was the 'most important person in the company', a tribunal heard.
Anna Mazover, 29, and Diana Nicholl-Pierson, 24, claim sales director Darren Scott leered at them and made sexual remarks while they worked for up to £3,000 a day at London publishing firm Entico.
He even followed Miss Mazover to a tube station on a lunch break, trying to cuddle the blonde Ukrainian former synchronised swimmer and touch her legs, she claimed.
The pair appeared again today at the Central London Employment Tribunal, where they are seeking a combined £110,000 for sexual harassment, victimisation, race discrimination and poor treatment after whistleblowing.
Both women say they were unfairly sacked after complaining about married Mr Scott's lewd behaviour.
Miss Mazover told him she was satisfied in her relationship and asked him to stop following her, she said in evidence today.
She continued: 'I then further added, "If you start doing this again, I will complain to [company director] James [Ramsay], and if necessary, I will leave my job.'
But she said that in June last year, Mr Scott told her it would not matter if she went to Mr Ramsey - as the company director was 'too preoccupied' with his boyfriend.
She claimed Mr Scott told her: 'I know James' boyfriend and he always cheats on James with another man, and James is always upset.'
She added: 'He said to me James is nothing. I am here making all the decisions - James is nothing in the company. He is always very upset his boyfriend cheats on him.
'He said to me: "I am the main and most important person in the company, you can't go over me."'
When it was put to her that this was a 'complete fabrication', Miss Mazover responded: 'How would I know that James has a boyfriend, who is gay or not?'
Miss Mazover and Ms Nicholl-Pierson both claim Mr Scott bragged to them about taking cocaine and hiring prostitutes, and showed them photos of scantily-clad women on his work computer.
Adam Gadd, representing Mr Scott, asked Miss Mazover why she had left it so late to tell his client she would complain to company director Mr Ramsay.
She replied: 'I worked there only three weeks and I wanted to achieve something at my work.
'And why should I leave if something is wrong? Maybe justice should exist in that world... Why [could] nothing be done to protect me at my work place and protect my rights?'
Miss Mazover claimed that on May 21 last year, her second in the job, Mr Scott propositioned her and Ms Nicholl-Pierson with a threesome.
She also said she had raised concerns earlier in the evening about his behaviour with human resources employee Sara Goerg.
Mr Scott, 55, is alleged to have told the women: 'It would be nice if we go back together to my penthouse and have a threesome.
'If you have a threesome, you both would prosper within the company and get promoted.'
The panel heard that even after Miss Mazover threatened to go above Mr Scott's head, he followed her to the tube station a few days later.
She told the panel previously that he had offered her a spending spree at Harrods, adding: 'He harassed me and asked to me come to his penthouse to have oysters and champagne with him.
'The second respondent [Mr Scott] then again said, "maybe your boyfriend's d*** is big, but my wallet is bigger".'
Both women complained to HR, the panel heard, but at the beginning of June when no action had been taken Ms Nicholl-Pierson went to the police and made a formal complaint.
Director Mr Ramsay then called both women into his office and told them there were no grounds for their complaints, she said - before they were both dismissed with no explanation.
Both women, who earned up to £3,000 a day, are bringing the claims on the grounds of sexual harassment, victimisation, race discrimination and whistleblowing.
Ms Mazover is claiming £41,000, while Ms Nicholl-Pierson is claiming £67,000.
Their tribunal claim is being made jointly against Entico, Mr Scott and Mr Ramsay.
Miss Mazover, the daughter of a Ukrainian businessman, also said Mr Scott mocked her accent and made derogatory comments about Russian women, implying they were easy, and one day greeted her with, 'Good morning, Red Army'.
Mr Scott denies all of the allegations against him.
The hearing continues.
