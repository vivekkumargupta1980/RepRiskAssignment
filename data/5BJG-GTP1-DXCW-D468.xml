A federal jury convicted Jean Claude Roy, a/k/a “Dredd the Don,” and “Dreddy,” age 31, of Germantown, Maryland, late yesterday of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion, three counts of interstate transportation for prostitution, and witness and evidence tampering.
The verdict was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division Jocelyn Samuels; Special Agent in Charge William Winter of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); and Chief J. Thomas Manger of the Montgomery County Police Department.
"This defendant preyed on vulnerable young women and exploited them for prostitution,” stated Acting Assistant Attorney General Samuels. “The Civil Rights Division is committed to seeking justice on behalf of victims of human trafficking."
“Protecting our communities from those who engage in human trafficking is a top priority for HSI,” said William Winter, special agent in charge of HSI Baltimore. “As a member of the Maryland Human Trafficking Task Force, HSI is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate human trafficking, as well as working with our local non-governmental, community-based and faith-based organizations to identify, rescue and assist victims of trafficking.”
According to evidence presented during the two week trial, between August and September 2012 Roy transported a victim across state lines to engage in prostitution. He also took the victim’s identity documents, kept all of the victim’s money, and bragged to her about beating murder charges.
In November 2012 Roy recruited co-defendant Brittney Creason to engage in prostitution at Roy's direction. Thereafter, Creason helped Roy recruit and transport girls from Illinois and North Carolina to engage in prostitution. Roy conspired to force the women to engage in prostitution by again bragging about beating murder charges, taking their identity documents and taking their money.
Trial evidence also showed that from January 1 to January 10, 2013, while Roy was in jail on related state charges, he called an individual several times and had that person access online accounts and storage services belonging to Roy and Creason in order to erase evidence related to these charges.
Roy faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for conspiracy to commit sex trafficking; a maximum of 10 years in prison for each of three counts of interstate transportation for prostitution; and a maximum of 20 years in prison for witness and evidence tampering. U.S. District Judge Paul W. Grimm scheduled sentencing for July 16, 2014 at 9:30 a.m.
The jury found Roy not guilty of sex trafficking and attempted sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion; and possessing and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence.
Brittney Creason, a/k/a “Kitty Amor,” age 19, of Decatur, Illinois, previously pleaded guilty of using a facility in interstate commerce for an illegal activity, and awaits sentencing.
This case was investigated by the Maryland Human Trafficking Task Force, formed in 2007 to discover and rescue victims of human trafficking while identifying and prosecuting offenders. Members include federal, state and local law enforcement, as well as victim service providers and local community members.

Nolan of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division's Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit, who are prosecuting the case.
