PHS created the corporations - which do everything from clothes washing to pest control - to provide services to their buildings and, in some cases, to give jobs to vulnerable Downtown Eastside neighbourhoods. But damning audits released last week reveal the companies have a history of financial losses and many are owned, run or overseen by people with links to PHS - either as society employees, members or board directors.
The companies "present an elevated risk of fraud, corruption and abuse," says a 126-page KPMG audit completed last July for the provincial government, one of PHS's main funders.
The audit found the board of directors had "insufficient recognition" of the associated risks, potential contractual problems and governance issues, and recommended PHS try to stop doing business with its friends and staff.
1A 2014 audit for Vancouver Coastal Health, another key PHS funder, found eight spinoff companies owed the non-profit society $481,000 in outstanding cash advances as of October 2013, putting public funds "at risk."
"The rationale for setting up these companies initially is questionable as well as the lack of an ongoing assessment process to determine the continued benefit of operating them," says the VCH audit.
PHS managers told the auditors Bugs Be Gone pest control, for example, was created to provide timely bug treatment by people willing to work in challenging environments. It had to be a separate legal entity in order to buy the chemicals required, they said.
PHS managers did not respond to interview requests. The Sun was also unable to reach the owners or directors of the eight companies.
The revelation that PHS was essentially contracting services to itself was one of the main reasons the government recently axed the executive and asked the board to resign, said B.C. Housing Minister Rich Coleman. "It is suspect. There should be arms-length transactions. That was one of the alarm bells that came up as we went through this," he said.
"Some of this work could be tendered out to people. If it is a company owned by the society, then the perception is that nobody else gets to bid for the work."
Coleman said the new board will determine whether the companies provide social and financial value, and if they will be continued.
Because PHS is mainly supported by government grants, most of the companies therefore receive a large portion of their revenue from taxpayer dollars, the audits found.
Any losses or gains from these companies reverted to PHS, not the legal owners, because they were largely "controlled by PHS," the KPMG audit found. It found no proof, however, of any PHS managers double-dipping - that is, receiving income from both PHS and the affiliate companies.
The VCH audit found a conflict of interest, though, when a PHS manager, who is also the shareholder of Bugs Be Gone, approved a $13,887 payment from PHS to the firm. "Allowing the shareholder of a company PHS uses for services to authorize PHS payments creates the risk of erroneous invoices being approved," the audit says.
It was PHS policy to provide loans to the companies to help with cash flow. As such, the audits found PHS was owed significant amounts of money from some, including $161,783 from DTES Maintenance, $117,945 from
Our Community Security, and $96,999 from Bugs Be Gone.
Auditors uncovered other financial curiosities.
Andy Bond, a PHS employee who also owns DTES Janitorial Services, purchased wholesale cleaning supplies on his personal credit card, and then sold them back to PHS for markups averaging 30 per cent.
PHS management said the markups reflected Bond's costs of sourcing, purchasing, collecting, storing and delivering the supplies. Bond used his personal card because PHS had a limit on corporate cards it could obtain, managers said.
From 2010 to 2012, auditors found Bond charged $535,000 in expenses back to Janitorial Services that were largely for cleaning supplies. He also filed hefty expense claims to two other companies: $185,788 to Bugs Be Gone and nearly $5,000 to Mop Squad.
Phong Lam, a PHS employee and owner of three of the companies, filed $34,263 in expenses to DTES Maintenance from 2010 to 2012.
PHS frequently charged the affiliates for accounting, payroll, and other administrative services, but the fees were largely based on the companies' ability to pay, the audits found. For example, Bugs Be Gone paid $24,000 to PHS in 2010 but nothing in 2012.
The auditors raised concerns that in 2012, six of the eight companies paid PHS $162,000 in fees but only $125,000 was recorded as revenue in PHS books.
Four of the eight companies also paid rent to PHS for some or all of the three years audited, ranging from $12,000 to $24,000 annually.
PHS managers told the auditors they were in the process of moving these affiliates into a Community Contribution Company, a new hybrid corporate model that would allow PHS to own the shares.
