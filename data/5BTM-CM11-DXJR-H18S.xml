However, the Anti-Corruption Bureau here caught three men for allegedly offering bribe to the sarpanch of Dahegaon (Rangari) village. The trap was set up at a hotel in Sitabuldi on Monday afternoon following a complaint from Sarpanch Archana Choudhary.
Deepak Dhotre, 41, a resident of Zingabai Takli, Amol Korde, 32, and Umesh Chikole, 30, all three employees of B G Construction Company of Pune, were arrested for allegedly offering bribe to Choudhary. According to Choudhary, the company was opening its office at Dahegaon and had applied for power connection from MSEDCL. Though the land to be used for setting up transmission line comes under forest department, they needed NOC from Choudhary too.
However, due to some issues, Choudhary asked the company to wait for a few months. Dhotre, Korde and Chikole offered a bribe of Rs 50,000 to Choudhary to get their work done. Choudhary and her husband Kishore, however, alerted the ACB. As per the plan, Kishore called the three to meet him at a hotel at Sitabuldi where they were caught while handing over bribe money.
