Speaking at a rally held at Griffith Northside Leagues Club on Tuesday evening, Lock the Gate national co-ordinator Phil Laird warned of irreparable damage to local health, industry and community spirit.
Mr Laird encouraged the 16 concerned locals in attendance to host private viewings of two anti-coal seam gas (CSG) documentaries called Fractured Country: An Unconventional Invasion and Undermining Australia: Coal vs Communities.
"This area is completely dependant on ground water and contamination of irrigation could affect the green image of the produce," Mr Laird said.
"A new industry like CSG could displace the current industries here, because CSG poaches the skilled tradespeople.
"A town like Griffith could get 1000 men come to town if CSG gets up and running and the social impacts occur everywhere.
"People in Queensland have been getting negative health impacts which could also impact a big population like Griffith."
The land rights advocate shared stories of contamination from the Pilliga in northern NSW and Darling Downs in central Queensland.
"Griffith is in the box seat because exploration hasn't been approved yet so now's the time to form groups," Mr Laird said.
"Once they get ito an area they just keep ramping up and getting bigger and bigger.
"They drill like crazy to cover their lease area, then they start fracking and then comes infield drilling."
