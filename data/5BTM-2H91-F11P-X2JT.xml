In a press release issued on Monday, Urfalilar stressed that 43 percent of work accidents involving death and 33 percent of accidents involving injury in the construction sector stemmed from falling from buildings; he added that increasing the usage of formwork and scaffolding systems would significantly decrease the occupational hazards of working on a construction site. In a press release from May 2013, Urfalilar had said: "In the past 12 years, 12,686 people died from work-related accidents. Just in 2012, 278 construction workers died, 89 people in the agriculture and forestry sectors died, 83 in the energy sector and 80 workers in mine accidents." He said the highest number of on-the-job accidents occurs in Istanbul, followed by other industrial cities, such as Adana Ankara, Bursa, Gaziantep, Izmir and Konya.According to Urfalilar, on-site supervisors and technical crew should be more conscious about work safety. He also stressed that the aim of their association is to attain certain standards in the sector, which would include paying more attention to job safety. Another aim of KALISDER, Urfalilar explained, is to increase their involvement in worldwide construction projects. "Increasing [our] quality [of work] in the construction sector will help Turkey play a more important role in the construction market," he said.
