("InnerWorkings" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: INWK) of the April 28, 2014 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action lawsuit filed against InnerWorkings and certain executives.
A complaint has been filed on behalf of all persons who purchased InnerWorkings securities between February 15, 2012 and November 6, 2013, inclusive (the "Class Period") in the Northern District of Illinois.
The complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws with respect to its disclosures concerning its business, operations, and prospects.
Specifically, the action alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that the Company: (i) inflated its revenues while violating Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; and (ii) artificially inflated its cash flows and adjusted EBITDA.
On November 6, 2013, InnerWorkings lowered its 2013 revenue and earnings per share guidance due to the performance of its Productions Graphics business.
Following this news, the Company's stock declined $3.85 per share, or over 40%, to close at $5.64 per share on November 7, 2013.
Furthermore, on February 18, 2014, InnerWorkings announced it would need to restate its financial results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2011.
