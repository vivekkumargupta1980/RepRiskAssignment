The company in question, Kitchener-based Hybrid Turkeys, told The Record last week it had suspended four employees and called the abuse depicted in the video an isolated incident.
The video was shot at a Hybrid plant in Bright, Ont., by a member of the animal rights group, Mercy for Animals Canada.
Footage also shows workers apparently crushing the spines of birds while others are left to die from festering and bloody wounds.
"This investigation graphically illustrates that the hidden price of Canadian turkey meat is horrific animal abuse," said Twyla Francois, a spokesperson for Mercy For Animals.
"This is blatant animal cruelty that shouldn't be supported in a civilized society."
In anticipation of the video's release, Hybrid said last week it had taken immediate steps to ensure the ethical treatment of its turkeys.
"Hybrid has zero tolerance for animal abuse," managing director David Libertini said in a statement.
Hybrid said it would co-operate with any investigations into the abuse and had already initiated a third-party review of company policies and procedures.
Helen Wojcinski, the company's science and sustainability manager, said in an interview Friday she was concerned by what she had seen on the video.
"Employees are not using the method of euthanasia that we want them to use," Wojcinski said, noting blunt-force trauma is an approved killing method.
While the employees remain suspended, the company is still waiting to talk to them as part of its investigation because it didn't have the full, unedited video.
"It's trying to get the whole context or perspective," Wojcinski said.
The company also said it would become the first turkey producer in North America to employ mandatory video monitoring and veterinary review of all turkey euthanasia.
Mercy for Animals said national standards across the county need to be tightened to include immediate veterinary care for sick or injured birds.
All facilities that handle farmed animals should install video monitoring and livestream the footage on the internet, the group said.
The activists also called on the industry to forego some profits by stopping the breeding of turkeys for rapid growth that can leave them crippled under their own weight.
Some of the birds suffer from bone defects, hip-joint lesions, foot and leg deformities, and heart attacks as a result of the unnaturally fast growth, the group said.
More than 21 million turkeys are raised and killed for food every year in Canada - of which about 60 per cent come from Hybrid.
Hendrix Genetics, the parent company of Hybrid Turkeys, is the second largest producer in the world.
Dr. Mike Petrik, a poultry vet based in Guelph, said the video had been cut to show the situation in the worst possible light and was not representative of the care turkeys receive in Ontario.
"Having said that, there are things on the video that are abnormal and unacceptable."
