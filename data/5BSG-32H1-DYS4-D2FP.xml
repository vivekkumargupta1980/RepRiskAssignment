The Agency for State Financial Control and Fight against Corruption under the president of Tajikistan has appealed to the economic court of the country with a lawsuit to invalidate the deal on the purchase by the company belonging to Ukrainian businessman Dmytro Firtash of a 75% stake is CJSC Tajikazot.
"The agency considers the acquisition of 75% in Tajikazot to be illegal, and therefore we believe that these shares should be returned to the state," authority official representative Abdukarim Zaripov told reporters.
The authority believes that after the purchase in 2002 of Tajikazot by Highrock Holdings Limited, owned by Firtash, part of its equipment was sold and the capacity of the company was not fully used, which is contrary to the terms of its privatization. The company is located in the town of Sarband in the south of Tajikistan. A 25% stake in the company belongs to the government of Tajikistan.
CJSC Tajikazot was engaged in production of nitrogen fertilizers for the agricultural sector, currently the plant is standing idle.
Group DF, uniting the assets of Firtash, did not comment on the situation with Tajikazot.
