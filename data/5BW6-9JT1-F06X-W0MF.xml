The banks include Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS. The Swiss Competition Commission joins a host of other global regulators, including those in the U.K. and the U.S., that are trying to figure out whether financial firms manipulated currency markets.

RBS' previous CFO Nathan Bostock resigned in December to join Santander. Wall Street Journal, Financial Times
Cavanaugh's, Gorman's Pay Days: A regulatory filing has revealed Mike Cavanagh - who announced last week that he was leaving JPMorgan Chase for private equity firm Carlyle Group - will receive a $39 million payout, thanks to the move. Most of that figure comes courtesy of $32 million in restricted stock Cavanagh will receive to make up for the uninvested JPM stock he was giving up to take the new position. His actual salary will total about $7 million a year for his first three years. News outlets point out this is significantly less than the $17 million Cavanagh received last year in pay from JPM. However, he is expected to make much more down the line as part of a new remuneration plan Carlyle has to keep talent long-term. Meanwhile, another regulatory filing shows James Gorman, Morgan Stanley CEO, will receive $18 million for his work in 2013. The figure, nearly double that of the compensation Gorman received the prior year, was bolstered by a $6 million long-term incentive. New York Times, Bloomberg
