The locals suggest that these funds should be distributed among 13 rural municipalities.“Kyrgyz citizens work 12 hours a day and are paid 15,000 som. No labor agreement was signed with them. We attempted to complain several times, but the problem was not resolved. They tell us – leave if you want. But people have no other alternatives to work,” the local council vice chairman said.The claims are addressed not to the Altynken LLC, but Chinese contractors, Beishnliyev said.“However, Altynken bears responsibility before the law, it is the main contractor. We are concerned that our workers are not insured against rock falls. They have no any agreements signed, which means they won't have any rights and compensations if any incident occurs. A local was severely injured at the mine, he had electrical injury, but did not receive any compensation from the company,” the local official said.© News Agency АKИpress - 2001-2014 Provided by Syndigate.info, an Albawaba.com company
