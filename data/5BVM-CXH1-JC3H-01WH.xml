路 He claimed it reduces vulnerability from Mideast oil sources. Sorry, but every drop of this Canadian oil is contracted to be refined on our Gulf Coast and then exported.
路 Canadians need a way to export their dirty oil and 60 percent of British Columbia residents oppose building a pipeline west across Canada directly to the west coast due to fears of spills and pollution on their lands.
路 The writer claims 20,000 construction jobs are to be created. Those are temporary jobs. Estimates are only 35 permanent jobs will result from Keystone.
路 The writer notes his military background so just wondering if he is aware of the security threat from climate change. Keystone tar sands oil produces 20 percent more greenhouse gas pollution and a particularly nasty refinery byproduct that Americans will be forced to dispose of. The Pentagon has warned in numerous reports that climate change presents one of the greatest threats to national security from potential mass population dislocation from sea level rise, droughts and famine.
Why should the U.S. allow a dangerous pipeline to cross our country when we don't benefit? Why are Canadians opposing a similar pipeline crossing their country if there aren't significant safety issues? Let's have an honest discussion with all the important facts examined and avoid all the hyperpartisan spin.
