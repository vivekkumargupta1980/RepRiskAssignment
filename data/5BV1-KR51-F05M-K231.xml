Consumers will begin receiving the money this week, and more money could possibly be available in the future, according to a release from Attorney General Martha Coakley's office.
The amount that Massachusetts consumers receive will be based on the number of eligible e-books purchased by them through retailers such as Amazon or Barnes & Noble between the dates of April 1, 2010 and May 21, 2012, according to the release.&nbsp;
Consumers will receive $3.17 per e-book that was a New York Times bestseller, and $0.73 for each non-New York Times bestseller purchase, according to the release.
The lawsuit alleged that Apple and five of the country's largest e-book publishers conspired to eliminate retail price competition in order to raise e-book prices, which violated federal and state antitrust laws, according to a release.
