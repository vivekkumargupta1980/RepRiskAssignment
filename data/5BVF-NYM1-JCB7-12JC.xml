MORGANTOWN - Law students will tackle power plant issues at the annual National Energy & Sustainability Moot Court Competition in Morgantown.
The three-day competition starts Thursday at West Virginia University's Erickson Alumni Center. The competition is being hosted by the WVU College of Law.
Twenty-four teams from across the country are competing.
This year, students will sharpen their skills on legal problems faced by a fictitious state and a company that owns a thermal power plant and a hydropower facility. The case was developed by James Van Nostrand, director of the school's Center for Energy and Sustainable Development; energy and environmental law and police fellow Beren Argetsinger and WVU law student Joshua Cottle.
W.Va. to get nearly $700,000 in lawsuit
West Virginia consumers who might have overpaid for e-books will receive nearly $700,000 from the partial settlement of a national lawsuit.
Attorney General Patrick Morrisey's office announced Wednesday the refunds are being paid out to consumers who purchased electronic books from some publishers from April 2010 to May 2012. The refunds are in the form of account credits, coupons or checks.
The lawsuit was filed by 33 states against Apple Inc. and five of the nation's six largest e-book publishers. The publishers settled claims against them for a total payment of $166 million.
Apple is battling claims in district court that it violated antitrust laws.
