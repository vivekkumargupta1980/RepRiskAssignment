Having sat for almost five hours recently while Cardinal Pell was questioned by the royal commission, I was amazed by his cold indifference to the evidence presented.
This week he offered an apology to one of the victims of this Australian horror story.
He can now trundle off to Vatican City to take control of the inestimable wealth of the Catholic Church - safe and protected from the questions and criticism of our media and all those victims left in the wake of paedophile priests.

End child detentions THE Australian Human Rights Commission's findings from its national inquiry into children in immigration detention are as heartbreaking as they are unsurprising.
Children do not belong in prison.
Jesuit Social Services has many years experience supporting young people and adults leaving prison, and even for adults, the prison experience is dehumanising and often terrifying.
It offends every principle of decency and humanity that we would inflict this harm on children. How we treat children is surely the test of our nation's character and soul.
We call upon our Government to release all children from detention into the community immediately.
Julie Edwards, CEO, Jesuit Social Services
Dons' queries remain REVELATIONS concerning Essendon Football Club employees being the subject of undocumented injections of an unknown substance in the workplace in a systematic program of assumed performance enhancement caused me to contact the Victorian WorkCover Authority.
After nearly three months of persistent inquiry, having pursued this matter with the VWA, my local member of Parliament, the State Attorney General and the Premier, an answer from the Assistant Treasurer was finally forthcoming.
It would appear that the VWA has abrogated its statutory responsibilities, preferring to wait for the outcome of the ASADA investigation before "considering ASADA's findings when available".
Clearly there is a distinction to be made between sports doping and systemic breaches of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004. ASADA has confirmed in writing that there is nothing in the ASADA legislation that precludes any investigation by a state-based workplace OH&S authority.
I wonder if pressure has been applied by either the AFL and/or timid politicians to the VWA to preclude appropriate investigations into this matter.

Blame AFL for crowds ROUND 1 AFL crowds were their lowest in nearly 20 years.
No "blockbusters" were scheduled in the split round and a total of 245,301 attended. Last year, the Round 1 total was just under 366,000. In a game that is growing and is in a healthy financial state, this figure was pathetic.
Andrew Demetriou must take responsibility.

Tania Hird impresses I WAS offended that Paul Little said James Hird should "control those around him". I was delighted when Tania Hird said she found it offensive to suggest she would be "hauled" before anyone, i.e. the Essendon board. She is her own person and will not be pushed around.

Stand by your man FREE speech, when defending your husband, is one thing that should never be taken away. Marriage vows mean sticking by each other, in good times and in bad.
