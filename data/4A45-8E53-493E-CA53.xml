The Premier's legal team was supposed to present its case by yesterday, but had asked for a 45-day extension to collect more evidence, the National Anti-Corruption Commission said. They had been granted a shorter extension of 15 days.
The NACC filed charges last month claiming Ms Yingluck had ignored warnings a rice subsidy scheme was fostering corruption and causing financial losses.
Ms Yingluck has protested her innocence, but if found guilty faces an impeachment vote in the upper house and a possible five-year ban from politics, as well as potential imprisonment.
The rice scheme, which guarantees farmers above-market rates, has become a lightning rod for anger among anti-government protesters. They say it has encouraged corruption, drained the public coffers and left the country with a mountain of unsold stock.
The government has faced months of mass protests calling for Ms Yingluck to step aside in favour of an unelected ``people's council'' to tackle what opponents see as a culture of money-driven politics. They accuse Ms Yingluck's elder brother, Thaksin Shinawatra -- a billionaire tycoon-turned-premier ousted from office by royalist generals in 2006 -- of running the government from overseas, where he lives to avoid a jail term for corruption.
The backdrop is a longstanding struggle between a royalist establishment backed by the judiciary and the military and Ms Yingluck's billionaire family, which has strong support in the northern half of Thailand.
Her administration has limited caretaker powers because opposition demonstrators disrupted a general election last month.
