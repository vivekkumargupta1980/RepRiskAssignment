Putin signed the accord with the region's new Moscow-backed leaders appropriating the region and its vital naval port of Sevastopol less than two days after voters backed secession from Ukraine in a widely criticized referendum. The treaty, which is expected to be ratified by the Russian parliament and the Constitutional Court, were signed in a solemn atmosphere in the Kremlin's lavish St. George's Hall.
Shortly before, Putin gave a fiery televised speech often interrupted by applause from jubilant lawmakers, government officials and other dignitaries.
While continuing to deny that the thousands of Russian troops in Crimea constituted an armed invasion, Putin reiterated his claim that Ukraine in recent weeks came under the rule of fascists and "Russophobes" based in Kiev, the capital.
Putin justified the takeover of Crimea as fulfilling Russia's "historic legacy." Crimea "should be part of a strong and stable sovereignty, which today can only be Russian," he said, stating that Kiev "isn't in control of anything."
Crimea was part of the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic after the Bolshevik Revolution. It was transferred to the administrative control of Soviet Ukraine in 1954 in a gesture that had little strategic meaning when both republics were part of the Soviet Union.
Ukraine's interim president, Oleksandr Turchynov, vowed that Kiev would never accept Russia's seizure of Crimea. "The Ukrainian people and the entire civilized world will never recognize the annexation of Ukrainian land," he said, according to the Unian news agency.
Vice President Joe Biden, on a mission to reassure Eastern European NATO members that the Western alliance will protect them from any Russian aggression, warned that Russia will face increasingly painful sanctions if Putin continues to pursue the "dark path" of violating the territorial integrity of a sovereign neighbor. The U.S. and the European Union on Monday imposed sanctions against some Russian and Ukrainian officials, but Western options seem limited.
"The world has seen through Russia's actions and has rejected the flawed logic," Biden said at his meeting in Poland with leaders of Russia's former communist allies who have been unnerved by what many consider the Kremlin's brazen land grab.
Putin boasted in his speech that Russia had recovered Crimea "without a shot fired" through the careful actions of local self-defense forces -- Moscow's description of the Russian troops that have deployed by the thousands throughout Crimea.
A confrontation Tuesday between Russian and Ukrainian forces, however, turned deadly when Russian snipers reportedly opened fire in the center of Simferopol, the Crimean capital. A Ukrainian soldier died and two others were injured, prompting the Ukrainian Defense Ministry to order its servicemen to return fire if attacked, Unian reported. Russia's ITAR-Tass agency said one member of the local self-defense forces was killed and two wounded.
Kremlin-controlled media have cast European Union and U.S. diplomatic contacts with Ukraine's political opposition in the months before Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia last month as meddling aimed at turning the country against its natural alliance and integration with Russia.
Pressure from Putin prompted Yanukovych to abandon an EU association deal that would have boosted Ukraine's trade and economic cooperation with Western Europe, which sparked rebellion against the autocrat, who fled after signing a EU-brokered peace deal Feb. 21.
Putin and the pro-Russian leaders installed in Crimea less than three weeks ago signed a treaty Tuesday to add the peninsula to the Russian Federation's territory by the end of this year. The agreement has to be ratified by parliament, but that is a mere formality in a legislature dominated by Putin loyalists.
Putin's justification for seizing Crimea "showed in high relief what a real threat Russia is for the civilized world and international security," Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Evhen Perebinis said, declaring the annexation a deviation from law and "sensible thinking."
