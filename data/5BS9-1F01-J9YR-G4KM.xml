A top Fifa official and his sons were allegedly paid nearly £1.2million by a Qatari firm linked to the country's successful bid for the 2022 World Cup.
Jack Warner, the former vice-president of the governing body, was reportedly paid £720,000 from a company run by an ex-Qatari football official weeks after the winner was announced.
Mr Warner was one of 22 people who decided to award the World Cup finals to Qatar
His sons - Daryll and Daryan - also received payments totalling £450,000, while one of his employees was paid a further £240,000, according to documents seen by the Daily Telegraph.
The payments to Mr Warner appear to come from a company called Kemco which is owned by Mohamed Bin Hammam, an ex-member of Qatar's Fifa committee.
The two men's Fifa careers ended in disgrace after they were caught up in a corruption scandal surrounding Bin Hammam's campaign for the presidency of the world governing body in 2011.
Mr Warner had allegedly requested the £720,000 payment for work carried out between 2005 and 2010 in a note dated December 15, 2010 - two weeks after Qatar won the World Cup bid.
In one document, it is said the payments are to 'offset legal and other expenses'.
Another letter claims that more than £600,000 was to cover 'professional services provided over the period 2005-2010'.
The FBI is believed to be investigating Trinidad-based Mr Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid.
Mr Warner's eldest son, who lives in Miami, is reportedly helping with their enquiries.
The payments were initially declined by a bank in the Cayman Islands over fears of the legality of the transaction, but were accepted by a bank in New York, bring it to the attention of the FBI.
A source told the Telegraph: 'These payments need to be properly investigated. There are lots of questions that still need to be answered.'
Mr Warner resigned in June 2011 after he was accused of facilitating bribes on behalf of Bin Hammam to members of the Caribbean football union.
Bin Hammam was running for Fifa president against Sepp Blatter at the time.
Mr Warner had also been accused by England 2018 bid boss Lord Triesman of asking for business deals in return for his support.
A spokesman for Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee told the Telegraph: 'The 2022 bid committee strictly adhered to FIFA's bidding regulations in compliance with their code of ethics.
'The supreme committee for delivery and legacy and the individuals involved in the 2022 bid committee are unaware of any allegations surrounding business dealings between private individuals.'
Mr Warner and his family declined to comment.
