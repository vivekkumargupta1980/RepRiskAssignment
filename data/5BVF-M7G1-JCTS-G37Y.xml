For the reality of clean coal, read the Associated Press article, &Tweak to N.C. law protected Duke's coal ash pits.& For years Duke Energy (the largest electric power company in the U.S.) has been polluting the ground in North Carolina with leaky, unlined coal ash dumps. All these dumps had been cited for polluting groundwater. Duke did nothing but buy up residential properties abutting the still-leaking dumps.
In 2013, environmental groups sued to force Duke to clean up 37 leaking dumps. Documents collected by the AP showed how Duke lobbyists got Republican legislators in North Carolina to tuck a provision in a regulatory bill that allowed Duke to avoid any costly cleanup of their contaminated groundwater that was still leaching into rivers, lakes and drinking wells. The bill was signed by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, who had worked at Duke for 28 years!
Then on Feb. 2, 2014, a Duke dump ruptured, coating 70 miles of the Dan River with a toxic sludge of arsenic, lead and mercury. On March 20, the AP reported Duke Energy illegally pumped 61 million gallons of contaminated water from two coal ash pits into a canal leading to the Cape Fear River, which provides drinking water to several cities and towns. There is no &clean coal& and North Carolina is just one example.
