The Charlotte energy giant promises to pay the costs incurred in removing coal ash from the Dan River. As much as 39,000 tons of coal ash - powdery residue that is the waste product left over from the process of generating electricity -&nbsp; was accidentally released near Eden in a spill discovered on Feb. 2.
But the company (NYSE:DUK) has said any future cost of remediating its ash pond sites would be part of the expense of generating electricity, and that falls to the ratepayer.
Activist organization Charlotte Environmental Action is opposed to that idea, arguing that the cleanup should be paid out of Duke's profits.
One of the demonstrators, Kathy Sparrow, has lived for 35 years near Riverbend Steam Station, which has a pair of ponds a few miles upstream from the Mountain Island Lake, source of 80% of the Charlotte area's drinking water. Sparrow said she also came out to "express support" of the criminal investigation of any improper ties between Duke and state regulators.&nbsp;
A federal grand jury is meeting for three days this week to hear testimony from subpoenaed officials with the energy company, N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the N.C. Utilities Commission. Click&nbsp; here and&nbsp; here for more details.
A Duke spokeswoman declined to comment on Wednesday's protest.
