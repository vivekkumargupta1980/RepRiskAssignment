The Alfa Romeo 4C is set to take part in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) but not as part of the cars on the grid.
Instead, the 4C will be the safety car for the 2014 season, with the award-winning coupe hitting the track for the first time between April 12th-13th at the Moulay El Hassan circuit in Marrakech.
It was chosen for the WTCC after taking the title of 'Most Beautiful Car of 2013' at the 29th International Automobile Festival of Paris.
The car is able to achieve a 0-62mph time of 4.5 seconds, while a top speed of 160mph is attainable. This is thanks to a combination of the 240hp 1750 turbo petrol engine, the latest-generation 'Alfa TCT' dry twin clutch transmission and the advanced Alfa DNA selector complete with Race mode.
The final race of the season will take place on the weekend of the 14th November, with the WTCC heading to the Da Guia Circuit in Macau.

11 March 2014: Bristol Street Group Ltd: Vauxhall adds 'whisper diesel' Astra to fleet lineup
Vauxhall will unveil its new 'whisper diesel' engine Astra, which is the quietest and cleanest model the car maker has ever produced. The super-quiet and smooth new generation 1.6-litre CDTi engine offers fuel consumption of up to 73.6mpg and carbon emissions of just 97g/km, which will reduce the road tax burden on fleet operators in the UK. The new model will be introduced to businesses at the Fleet World Fleet Show at the Silverstone Circuit on April 9th. This follows on from the debut of the 'whisper diesel' engine in an Astra model at the Geneva Motor Show earlier this month, where 110PS and 136PS versions were in attendance, in hatchback and sports tourer body types. The engine is regarded as best-in-class in terms of noise and vibration generation due to the optimised components it is manufactured from and the improved efficiency of its combustion process and multiple injection. Vauxhall's new 1.6-litre CDTi Astra is available to order now with first deliveries expected from April, with prices starting at Pound17,635 for the 1.6-litre CDTi 16v (110ps) ecoFLEX.
