These shocking images show men and women tanning leather for a pittance in one of the world's most polluted locations. 
A young woman no older than 16 is captured at the Hazaribagh toxic leather tannery in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which is ranked among the 30 most polluted places in the world. 
Every day, the tanneries collectively dump 22,000 cubic litres of toxic waste, including cancer-
causing chromium, into the Buriganga - Dhaka's main river and a key water supply - according to the
environment ministry.
It is not surprising that the river crossing the city is the third most polluted river in the world yet residents wash and do their chores in it everyday. 
Mokter Hossain spends everyday knee deep in toxic chemicals while loading animal hides into huge drums.
Doctors have already warned him that his job could one day kill him.
The 25-year-old, who has spent years inhaling fumes from the hexavalent chromium and other chemicals used to turn the raw hides into soft leather, told AFP: 'Some days I am too ill to work.
'I take medicine to control my skin diseases. If I don't, it gets worse' as he points to rashes and black spots on his skin.
Hossain's tannery is one of 200 in Hazaribagh in Dhaka, where some 25,000 people work for as little
as £30 a month to produce leather for shoes and other goods in Europe and the United States.
Ten months ago, Western retailers were forced into action after a garment factory collapsed
killing 1,135 people.
However, there are few signs of reform at Bangladesh's leather industry, where conditions are equally
atrocious but business is booming thanks to the West's growing demand for cheap, leather items.
Local activist Rizwana Hasan said: 'In these tanneries, death comes slowly.
'(So) While Bangladesh garment disasters make headlines across the world, the even more terrible
conditions at the tanneries don't.
'These tanneries remind us of factories in the 19th century.'
An AFP reporter recently saw children as young as 14 working inside one tannery, whose floor was awash with chromium effluent and where cow and goat skins caked in salt were stacked in piles.
It has also been highlighted that it is difficult to link specific tanneries to individual Western retailers.
'It is worse than hell. But we don't have any choice,' said Munia, 19, who has developed breathing problems.
Activist Hasan has been embroiled in a long legal battle to get the tanneries relocated outside of
Dhaka and equipped with waste treatment plants.
She blames close links between government and powerful owners of the tanneries, a vital source of
employment, for the lack of action.
The government concedes tanneries are breaking environmental laws, but favours persuading, rather than forcing them, to improve.
'Both the Western buyers and the tanners are addicted to Hazaribagh's cheap labour and lax
environmental enforcement standards. It won't go away unless we have pressure from all sides,' said
Hasan.
Apex Adelchi, which supplies to retailers such as Macy's in the United States, and UK-based Jones
Bootmaker which owns Clarks, have set up environmental-friendly tanneries.
