Green America claimed that chemicals used in themanufacturing of the popular smartphones can lead to cancer, nerve damage andreproductive health issues. The group said that employees were sometimes giveninadequate training on the use of the chemicals and often did not have accessto protective clothing.
Chemicals identified by Green America include n-hexane, whichis used to clean handset displays because it evaporates quickly. The solvent cancause nerve damage and, in extreme cases, paralysis, according to Green America.The environmental group also cited the use of benzene, a cancer-linkedsubstance used to coat certain electronic components.
None of the practices convene Chinese health and safety regulations,but Green America is calling on Apple to demand safer chemicals across itssupply chain. The group claims the changes would raise the costs by less than$1 per device.
"Apple is a highly popular brand, one that consumers trustand expect to act responsibly," said Elizabeth O'Connell, campaigns director atGreen America.
"Apple is also highly profitable so it can easily afford todo right by its workers and make the necessary changes to appeal to itssocially-conscious consumers."
