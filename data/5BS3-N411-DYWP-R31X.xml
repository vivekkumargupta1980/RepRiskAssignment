But Indonesian authorities appear determined to resolve the problem which has disrupted flights and caused thousands of residents to suffer from respiratory illnesses.
Police have warned those who are illegally slashing and burning land to stop immediately or risk being shot. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono also wants a crackdown on companies responsible for the fires. Dr Yudhoyono was in Riau to oversee emergency response to the fires. Despite it being an immediate response, the president is not just looking to put out the fires, but also to prevent them. He is urging local authorities to effectively handle the situation before his term expires, as he said he is reluctant to have the next president deal with the problem. Dr Yudhoyono also said he wants a crackdown on companies behind the fires in Riau, an end to illegal logging, as well as procedures in place to prevent fires and detect them early. And it seems authorities want to show they are serious about tackling the problem. National Police Chief General Sutarman has declared that the police would shoot on sight any suspects involved in burning activities and who resist arrest. He added that this should apply to security and government officers allegedly involved in land burning. So far, police have named 65 suspects including an employee of a plantation firm. Most have been identified as local farmers. A special team of over 550 officers, including military and forest rangers, has been tasked with hunting down those responsible for setting land and forest fires in Riau.Â
