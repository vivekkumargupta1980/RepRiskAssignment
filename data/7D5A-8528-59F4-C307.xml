In what became the country's worst offshore environmental disaster, BP's Macondo well blew out in 2010, killing 11 workers and spewing more than 4 million barrels of oil into the gulf.
BP continued to operate its offshore projects and pursue new ones until November 2012, when it was suspended by the EPA from bidding on federal contracts, including offshore leases. At the time, the EPA cited BP's "lack of business integrity" as demonstrated by the Macondo disaster. BP, in turn, sued the EPA in 2013 in an effort to overturn the ban.
Under the new agreement, BP must retain an EPA-approved independent auditor to conduct an annual review and ensure the company is in compliance with various provisions, including standards for safety, corporate governance and ethics compliance. The EPA retains the right to take "appropriate corrective action" if the agreement is breached, the regulator said.
In return, BP agreed to drop its suit against the EPA.
BP pleaded guilty in 2012 to criminal charges in connection with the spill and agreed to pay $4.5 billion in fines and other penalties. BP and the federal government are still locked in a civil trial over BP's violation of the Clean Water Act.
