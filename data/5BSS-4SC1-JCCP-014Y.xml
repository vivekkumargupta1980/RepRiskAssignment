EEOC Sues LaFontaine Buick For Racial Harassment
Dealership Subjected African-American Employee to Constant Racial Slurs Despite His Complaints, Federal Agency Charged
DETROIT - LaFontaine Buick Cadillac GMC, Inc., a Michigan automobile dealer, violated federal law by racially harassing an African-American detailer, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today.
The Highland Township-based automobile dealership illegally harassed William Tyler by subjecting him to racial slurs, including the "N-word," despite the fact he complained about the use of slurs by a co-worker who became his supervisor, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today.
Such alleged conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit, Civil Action No. 2:14-cv-11172, in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The EEOC seeks injunctive relief to prevent the company from engaging in any further racially discriminatory employment practices, as well as monetary relief for Tyler.
"Employees have a statutory right to a workplace free from racial harassment, and the employer has a duty to eliminate any such harassment after it has been brought to its notice," said EEOC Trial Attorney Dale Price. "The EEOC is here to stand up for the rights of the victims of this kind of misconduct."
The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws against employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available at www.eeoc.gov.
