The China Food and Drug Administration called for all relevant departments to carry out surprise inspections of local gelatin manufacturers and tighten examination of the entire production chain, including raw materials, purchases, production and sales.
On Saturday, media reported that some enterprises had used gelatin made from industrial waste leather to produce food and drug capsules.
Since gel capsules made from toxic chromium-tainted industrial gelatin were exposed in 2012, the administration has highlighted supervision of edible and drug gelatin products through measures such as increased inspection times and standardized production and operations.
In 2014, the administration issued a circular to prevent illicit sales and supervise use of gelatin.
The administration sent work teams to relevant areas for on-site inspection.
Also on Sunday, the administration issued a circular advising consumers to buy cosmetic lenses with medical device registration certificates.
The circular said that people may report fake product vendors to local food and drug watchdogs, which will handle illegal acts in line with the law.
