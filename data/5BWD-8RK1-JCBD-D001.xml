The group's Mopani subsidiary will announce within days that it has finished a £300m upgrade to a copper smelter that will ensure 97pc of sulphur dioxide gas is captured.
It comes after the Daily Mail revealed how locals' lives have been blighted by regular gas emissions, causing health problems and soil contamination.
Glencore initially planned to solve the problem by 2015.
But the firm brought the deadline forward to the end of 2013 amid intense pressure from campaign groups.
The company missed the new deadline, but boss Ivan Glasenberg later vowed that efforts to end pollution at Mopani would be finished by the end of March. Sophie Powell, Africa policy chief at Christian Aid, said it is shameful that it has taken Glencore 14 years to fix the devastating air pollution caused by its mine'.
She added that people in the nearby town of Kankoyo have reported damage to their homes caused by pollution and urged Glencore (up 0.35p to 309.15p) to pay towards rehousing townspeople.
