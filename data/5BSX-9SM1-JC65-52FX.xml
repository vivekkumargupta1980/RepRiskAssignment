(AP) - Three dozen western Pennsylvania organizations are asking state health officials to require that a Pittsburgh-area coke plant reduce emissions or close.
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette says the 36-member coalition of groups, small businesses and unions sent the demands to the Allegheny County health department.
They say the Shenango Inc. plant has a 35-year history of air pollution violations and violated county air quality standards on 330 days in a 432-day span.
A health department spokesman said officials will review the letter and respond.
Shenango's parent company DTE says it is negotiating with the county about its emissions and has been working on environmental performance since purchasing the plant in 2008.
The plant includes 56 ovens and processes 1,500 tons of coal per day. Coke is a fuel used to make steel.
