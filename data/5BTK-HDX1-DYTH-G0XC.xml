The move was made after Japanese media carried reports about a Tokyo-based company paying bribes to get ODA (official development assistance) project contract managed by the aforesaid company.
Deputy PM Phuc also assigned the Ministry of Public Security, the Supreme People's Procuracy, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Foreign Afairs to work with the Japanese side to collect necessary information.
Earlier, the Yomiuri Shimbun of Japan reported that President Tamio Kakinuma of the Japan Transportation Consultants, Inc (JTC) admitted the Tokyo-based railway consultant firm had offered corrupt financial incentives to a number of Vietnamese railway officials to win the bidding package for a Japanese ODA-funded railway project in Viet Nam.
Tamio Kakinuma confessed to the alleged bribes during questioning by the special investigation squad of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.
Several Japanese newspapers reported JTC had paid Vietnamese officials &#165; 80 million worth of kickbacks to win a &#165; 4.2 billion railway contract./.
On Sunday, the State-owned Viet Nam Railways has suspended Mr. Nguyen Van Hieu, director of the company's railway projects management unit and has been ordered to write a report./.
