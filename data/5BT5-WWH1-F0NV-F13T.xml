According to reports, as a result of an investigation begun in October, 2013, on Tuesday, March 18, 2014, Polk County Sheriff 's Office High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Task Force detectives, along with members of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Orlando District Office, Florida Attorney General's Office of Statewide Prosecution, and Lake County Sheriff's Office detectives, identified 25 suspects involved in an organized drug trafficking enterprise.
Reports say that through their investigation, detectives and agents learned the organized methamphetamine crime ring was responsible for the distribution of large amounts of methamphetamine in Lake, Orange, Osceola, Polk and Seminole Counties.
Investigators identified the organization's source of methamphetamine supply as Javier Flores, aka: "El Don." Flores resides in southern California and allegedly managed large scale methamphetamine shipments to Lakeland, Florida, Atlanta, Georgia, and Las Vegas, Nevada through southern California from Mexico. The organization included a network of couriers, managers, distributors and customers. In February, detectives intercepted a $200,170 cash delivery meant to pay for methamphetamine from a courier.
Investigators also learned Lopez and Flores consulted a Voodoo priest who would provide predictions, prophecies and readings regarding the organization's decisions and welfare, reports say.
On Tuesday, March 18, 2014, investigators intercepted 44 pounds of methamphetamine at Love's Truck Stop, 1800 Florida 559, in Polk City. The "uncut" street value of this amount is approximately $2 million. Also, on Tuesday, March 18, detectives arrested 13 suspects, seized tens of thousands of dollars, seven vehicles, approximately 100 weapons, bullet-proof vests, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Two children, ages 1 and 3, were removed from a residence and placed into DCF custody.
Out of 25 suspects in the organization, 11 are currently receiving Federal/public assistance, and one has been deported, is back in the country illegally, and is currently receiving Federal/public assistance (Ma-Concepcion Lopez), according to reports.
During the course of the investigation, detectives and agents learned two of those involved in the methamphetamine network were Josh Widdows, 30, of 5339 Meadow Grove Trail, Lakeland, and TJ Scott, 25, of 7708 Glen Meadow Dr., Lakeland.
Reports say Widdows and Scott were known to associate with Matthew Tutt, the man responsible for shooting and severely injuring two PCSO deputies in June 2010. At approximately 2:30 a.m., Friday, June 25, 2010, Deputies Mike Braswell and Paul Fairbanks were patroling in the area of Plateau Avenue and Josephine Street in the Wabash area of unincorporated Polk County near Lakeland. There had been a number of burglaries in the area. During their encounter, Tutt pulled a gun from under his shirt and shot at both deputies. Tutt was killed when deputies returned fire. Now retired, Deputy Paul Fairbanks was shot three times, and Deputy Mike Braswell was shot four times. Both deputies recovered. Widdows and Scott bought Meth from Rojas and in turn were selling the meth on the streets of Polk County, according to reports.
