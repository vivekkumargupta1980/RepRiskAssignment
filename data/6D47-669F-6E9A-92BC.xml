Officials said Sea Star Line LLC agreed to pay $1.9 million and Horizon Lines LLC $1.5 million to settle the cases.
The U.S. government had accused them of sharing confidential bidding information with each other to set predetermined rates for specific routes.
Officials said Friday the agreement affected contracts with the U.S. Postal Service and the Department of Agriculture, among others.
Both companies had previously pleaded guilty to anticompetitive conduct.
