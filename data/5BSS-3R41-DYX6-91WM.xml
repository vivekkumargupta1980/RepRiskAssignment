Marubeni and its partner in a consortium for the Indonesian power project paid bribes to Indonesian officials, including a high-ranking lawmaker and senior officials of a state-run power firm, according to the department.
The payments were made in exchange for assistance in securing a contract worth 118 million dollars, the department said.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars intended as bribe money were paid into an Indonesian bank account via a U.S. bank account of a consultant hired by the consortium, the department said.
On Wednesday, the department filed criminal information over the alleged bribery with a U.S. district court. Marubeni pleaded guilty to all eight counts of charges, including violation of antibribery provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
