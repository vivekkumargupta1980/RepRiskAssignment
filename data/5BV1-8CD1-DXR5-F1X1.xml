Takalani Tshivhase, who is charged with bribing a policeman with R5 million in a bid to secure a tender worth R182 million, was representing his company at the time, the Hawks say. Tshivhase is an executive director of the JSE-listed distribution company and this week again appeared in court on a charge of corruption. The matter has been postponed to 24 April for further investigation. Hawks spokesman, captain Paul Ramaloko, says Tshivhase was representing Pinnacle when he tried to persuade the South African Police Service to buy around 3 000 movement control devices, each worth R64 000. Tshivhase was trying to persuade the police to take MaxID units off Pinnacle's hands, says Ramaloko. MaxID units are handheld devices used by the police for investigation purposes and store information related to crimes, and are distributed locally by Pinnacle. Ramaloko says, if Pinnacle had won the order, it would have meant "something good" for the company. Pinnacle turned over R3.2 billion in the six months to December, and ended the period with a profit of R163.3 million. Web site (http://www.pinnacleholdings.co.za/index.php/directorate/pinnacle-technology-holdings) notes Tshivhase joined the company in 2003, after a "successful and varied career in government and commerce". It adds: "During his tenure at Pinnacle, he has demonstrably contributed to the growth and success of the Pinnacle Group through the successful penetration of key accounts, operational management and strategic direction."
