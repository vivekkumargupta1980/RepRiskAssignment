BP said it had reached agreement with America's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which will also see it withdraw a lawsuit challenging the suspension and open the way for it to enter into new leases in the Gulf.
Britain backed efforts to lift the ban and in December filed a statement to a US court considering the case that it "may have been excessive".
The company's prospects are seen as important to UK jobs and pension funds.
BP has been suspended from performing any new government work in America since November 2012, after it agreed to plead guilty and pay a 4.5 billion US dollar fine (Â£2.8 billion) for criminal charges over the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
