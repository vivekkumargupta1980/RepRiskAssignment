(AP) - An environmental law group says it's getting involved in a case involving a Duke Energy coal ash pit that coated 70 miles of the Dan River spill with toxic sludge because it cannot count on state regulators to do the right thing.
The Southern Environmental Law Center filed a motion Thursday to intervene in the state's enforcement action against Duke for pollution problems at the company's Dan River ash dump.
It's the latest action filed by the group on behalf of environmental groups, which say regulators have not done enough to force Duke to clean up nearly three dozen leaky, unlined ash pits across the state.
The group says regulators last year blocked them using the U.S. Clean Water Act to force the company to clean its coal ash pollution.
