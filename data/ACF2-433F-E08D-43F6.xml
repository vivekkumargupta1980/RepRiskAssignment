PCSO, DBPR crack down on unlicensed contractors
From Monday, March 3 through Thursday, March 6, the Polk County Sheriff's undercover deputies, working in conjunction with investigators from the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation did an investigation into unlicensed contractual work performed in Polk County. At the end of "Operation Tool Time," detectives arrested 20 people for advertising and proposing contracting work in Polk County without a professional business license.
"When you don't take the time to research the people you hire to do repairs in your home, you open yourselves up to being victimized. Don't trust your home repairs to people who aren't licensed and insured-spend the extra time and money verifying licenses and insurance credentials before letting someone into your home," said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. "Unlicensed contractors can perform shoddy work, resulting in damage, fires, or even injury."
During the operation, detectives answered ads placed online or in periodicals advertising home repairs, and scheduled appointments with those who placed the ads. The types of home repairs the suspects claimed they did ranged from plumbing to electrical. Those who provided written or verbal proposals to perform the work showed up at the location where the "work" was to be done, and were arrested for engaging in contracting business without a license
"Unlicensed activity not only threatens the livelihood of Florida's consumers, but it also takes away jobs from those who are licensed as required by law," said DBPR Secretary Ken Lawson. "Floridians should always verify an individual's professional license with my department prior to having any work performed on their home."
