But it has yet to reveal who those 12 people are -- even to the victims' family members.
GM CEO Mary Barra revealed that fact during a media roundtable in Detroit on Tuesday. It was the first time the new GM CEO has taken questions from reporters about the recall that has rocked the company in the early months of her tenure.
GM has been criticized because it has admitted that some employees were aware of problems with the ignition switch in small cars as early as 2004. The switch flaw led to at least 31 frontal accidents and at least 12 deaths, according to statistics released by GM. Barra again apologized Tuesday for the delay that occurred, and the deaths.
But Barra would not commit to releasing the list of frontal and fatal accidents caused by the switch failure, even when a probe by outside investigators hired by GM is complete.
"If we feel a need to do that and we feel it's appropriate," she said when asked when the company will release its list of fatalities tied to the recall. "But at this time we have not."
Barra also wouldn't answer repeated questions about whether GM will accept legal liability for the accidents that occurred before the 2009 bankruptcy. That bankruptcy process shields the current company from civil legal action. The Center for Auto Safety, a public interest group, has asked GM to waive that liability shield and accept responsibility.
Barra again pledged to change the way recalls are handled in order to move faster in the future. And she said GM will release the findings of the investigation now taking place.
"Our overriding goal is to be transparent," she said.
