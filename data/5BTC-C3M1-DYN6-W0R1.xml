A barge carrying nearly a million gallons of marine fuel oil collided with a ship Saturday afternoon, springing a leak. Officials believe only one of the barge's tanks - which holds 168,000 gallons - was breached, though the Coast Guard said Sunday it wasn't clear how much oil had spilled.
Crews were skimming oil out of the water and about six and half miles of containment booms were being used to protect environmentally sensitive areas of the Houston ship channel, the Coast Guard said, and it expects the leftover oil to be removed from the damaged barge Sunday, after which it will be taken to a local shipyard to be assessed.
The mouth of Houston ship channel, which is between Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula, is closed to all ships in either direction, Coast Guard Lt. Sam Danus said, noting that it is "communicating with the cruise ship companies."
The area is home to popular bird habitats, especially during the approaching migratory shorebird season, but Kendrick said there have been no reports of wildlife being impacted.
Also closed is the Texas City dike, a popular fishing spot that goes out into the Gulf for a few miles. Lee Rilat, 58, owns Lee's Bait and Tackle, the last store before the access road to the dike, which was blocked by a police car on a breezy, overcast Sunday. If it weren't for the spill, Rilat's business would be hopping.
"This would be the first spring deal, the first real weekend for fishing," Rilat said. He says ships and barges have collided before, but this is the first time - at least this year - that someone has sprung a leak. His wife, Brenda Rilat, said sea fog was hanging over the bay Saturday.
Rilat, who's lived in the area most of his life, doesn't think the spill is too big of a deal.
"It'll be fine. Everything's going to be lovely. Mother Nature takes care of its own," he said.
The collision was still being investigated, the Coast Guard said.
The captain of the 585-foot ship, Summer Wind, reported the spill just after noon Saturday. Six crew members from the tow vessel, which was going from Texas City to Bolivar, were injured, the Coast Guard said.
Kirby Inland Marine, which owns the tow vessel and barge, is working with the Texas General Land Office and many other federal, state and nonprofit agencies to respond to the spill, The Coast Guard said. Tara Kilgore, an operations coordinator with Kirby Inland Marine, declined to comment Saturday.
Jim Suydam, spokesman for the Texas' General Land Office, described the type of oil the barge was carrying as "sticky, gooey, thick, tarry stuff."
"That stuff is terrible to have to clean up," he said.
Richard Gibbons, the conservation director of the Houston Audubon Society, said there is important shorebird habitat on both sides of the ship channel. One is the Bolivar Flats Shorebird Sanctuary just to the east, which Gibbons said attracts 50,000 to 70,000 shorebirds to shallow mud flats that are perfect foraging habitat.
"The timing really couldn't be much worse since we're approaching the peak shorebird migration season," Gibbons said. He added that tens of thousands of wintering birds remain in the area.
Monday marks the 25th anniversary of the Exxon Valdez spill off the coast of Alaska. Suydam said that spill spurred the creation of the General Land Office's Oil Spill and Prevention Division, which is funded by a tax on imported oil that the state legislature passed after the Valdez spill.
