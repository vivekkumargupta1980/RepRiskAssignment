DTEK, the largest private energy holding of Ukraine, has confirmed that as a part of the investigation by the Swiss authorities into the activities of some former Ukrainian officials, the company has presented financial and legal documents of its Swiss subsidiaries to law-enforcement agencies of Switzerland for study.
"As the DTEK company is fully transparent and it operates strictly according to the law, we'll render assistance to the investigators," reads a response of the energy holding on the request of Interfax-Ukraine regarding the publication in Swiss media.
"We don't see any risks for our business due to the conducting of the investigation," DTEK said.
As reported, Swiss Sonntags Zeitung reported that investigations were being conducted at an office of DTEK Traiding S.A. as a part of the investigation into the operation of the coal trading company Mako Trading S.A. belonging to Oleksandr Yanukovych, the eldest son of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovuch.
Oleksandr Yanukovych is suspected of being involved in money laundering by Swiss police.
DTEK told Interfax-Ukraine that since February 27, the Swiss Prosecutor's Office has not conducted any additional actions, including searches, at DTEK Trading S.A.
"At present, trading transactions of DTEK are carried out in the usual regime, and contract liabilities to all partners are being fulfilled in full," the company said.
DTEK was established in 2005 to manage the energy assets of the System Capital Management group, owned by businessman Rinat Akhmetov. DTEK is a vertically integrated company involved in the production and enrichment of coal, and the generation and sale of electricity.
