("Galena" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: GALE) of the May 5, 2014 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action lawsuit filed against Galena and certain executives.
A complaint has been filed on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Galena common stock between November 6, 2013 and February 14, 2014, inclusive (the "Class Period") in the District of Oregon.
The complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws with respect to its disclosures concerning its business, operations, and prospects.
Specifically, the action alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that the Company was employing a misleading brand awareness campaign for the purpose of raising its stock price.
On February 12, 2014, an article published on TheStreet.com disclosed the misleading campaign and also alleged that the Company paid an investor relations firm to publish articles under aliases aimed at boosting Galena's stock price.
Subsequently, on February 14, 2014, the Company issued a shareholder letter admitting that it had employed the investor relations firm. Upon this news, the Company's stock declined $0.63 per share, or over 16%, to close at $3.73 per share on February 14, 2014.
