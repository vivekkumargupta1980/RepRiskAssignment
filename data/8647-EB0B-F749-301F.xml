Mar 14, 2014 (Mondaq:http://mondaq.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Fourteen-Year Sentence in EPA Superfund Case A New Antitrust RecordOn March 3, 2014, Gordon D. McDonald was sentenced[1] to 14 years' imprisonment for his "central role" in bid-rigging, kickback and fraud conspiracies related to two U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund sites in New Jersey. This is the longest prison sentence ever imposed for an antitrust crime, and is more than double the previous record[2] set late last year. A jury previously found McDonald guilty on 10 counts of an indictment alleging, in part, that McDonald and his co-conspirators agreed to rig bids and allocate subcontracts for wastewater treatment supplies and services to one of the Superfund sites. According to William Baer, assistant attorney general of the DOJ's Antitrust Division, the sentence "reflects the seriousness of the crimes committed [and] shows that if you engage in bid-rigging, fraud and kickback schemes your illegal actions will result in a longer prison sentence."

Following approximately six years of litigation, a comprehensive merits discovery during which the plaintiffs had "nearly unfettered access to defendants' records," and hundreds of depositions, the court concluded that the plaintiffs presented the court with "nothing more than speculation," and the court could not find that anything scandalous or improper occurred within the United States. The court noted that the chocolate defendants had increased their prices in a parallel manner during the relevant time period. Notwithstanding this parallel conduct, the court found that the plaintiffs were unable to demonstrate that these actions resulted from something other than the heavily concentrated nature of the chocolate market.First Charges in Ocean Shipping Services Antitrust ConspiracyOn Feb. 27, 2014, the DOJ's Antitrust Division filed its http://www.mcguirewoodsnews.com/rs/ct.aspx?ct=24F76D15DEE10AEDC1D180ACD6249311DDBE5588F8A52DA2349D55444994E339E9491683DA84138A2601393EAE1B44E29EE79A4207090F04FC8F634C82AC2F8EDA53808B425981E0500E6235689A7FEA19822E1first charges since it began its investigation into potential price fixing, bid rigging and other anticompetitive conduct in the international ocean shipping industry. The Chilean corporation Compañía Sud Americana de Vapores S.A. (CSAV), against which the charges were brought, agreed to plead guilty and pay a criminal fine of $8.9 million for its role in fixing prices, allocating customers and rigging bids of international ocean shipping services for "roll-on, roll-off cargo" — noncontainerized cargo that can be rolled onto and rolled off of an ocean-going vessel, such as cars and trucks and construction, mining and agricultural equipment. CSAV also agreed to cooperate with the DOJ's ongoing investigation of this conspiracy.For more information on our practice, see our http://www.mcguirewoodsnews.com/rs/ct.aspx?ct=24F76D15DEE10AEDC1D180ACD6249311DDBE5588F8A52DA2349D55444994E42FFD481692DADD1B8A345D7629B3591BC499F985484B1C0E4EDF8E5D5D93A9298ADA19B2CA0400C4A60A4E262C0CDD2DA00CCB1A5DAF7F82615E0CAC45FA4831B26F1antitrust and trade regulation page.
