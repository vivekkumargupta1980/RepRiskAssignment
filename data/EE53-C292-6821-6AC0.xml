BP said it had reached agreement with America's Environmental Protection Agency, which will also see it withdraw a lawsuit challenging the suspension and open the way for it to enter into new leases in the Gulf.
Britain backed eˆorts to lift the ban and in December led a statement to a US court considering the case that it "may have been excessive".
e company's prospects are seen as important to UK jobs and pension funds.
BP has been suspended from performing any new government work in America since November 2012, after it agreed to plead guilty and pay a £2.8bn ne for criminal charges over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster which cost 11 lives and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.
BP was banned for 16 months from leasing more oˆshore oil and gas properties and renewing fuel contracts with the US military.
