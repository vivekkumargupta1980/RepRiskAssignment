Selbie Manthata, his wife, Helen Moreroa, and his brother Makgetsi were acquitted. They were first arrested and charged with Malema in September 2012.
Their arrest followed Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's report on the "unlawful" R52 million tender awarded to On-Point by the Limpopo Roads and Transport Department.
Madonsela had found that the company misrepresented facts to win the contract.
Malema, On-Point directors Lesiba Gwangwa and Kagisho Dichabe and the Manthata family were charged with corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering. Yesterday, the Mokopane Regional Court dismissed the case against the Manthatas after they applied for acquittal through section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act.
Buoyed by the ruling, Malema reiterated his call for the National Prosecuting Authority to drop charges against him. The NPA has repeatedly rejected Malema's claims of political interference in his case.
