In a case brought before the Johannesburg High Court by the chief executive officer of Africa Cash and Carry, Edrees Ahmed Hathurani, Sibiya, the provincial head of the directorate of priority crime investigation, is accused of receiving bribes of R2 million to make charges of fraud and theft Hathurani had laid against the company's director, Cassim Aysen, three employees and a supplier, disappear.
Hathurani wants the court to interdict Sibiya and General Anwa Dramat, the national head of the directorate of priority crime investigation, from "interviewing, consulting or investigating criminal matters pertaining to the applicant" and order them to hand related criminal dockets to the minister of police.
He wants an independent investigative unit assigned to the case.
Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa and the National Director of Public Prosecutions, Mxolisi Nxasana, are cited as respondents.
Hathurani said in an affidavit he had brought several cases of fraud and theft against Aysen, the employees and supplier.
His affidavit and annexures, including a forensic audit, indicate the business lost R168m through the alleged fraud and theft.
There was also an affidavit from an employee who admitted involvement.
Hathurani said the charges he laid had followed the normal course of arrest, detention, investigation and prosecution "until the intervention of the second respondent (Sibiya)".
The papers say Sibiya convened a meeting in August of a Brigadier Magson from the Specialised Commercial Crime unit, Brigadier Ronnie Rajin from Joburg central police station and a Brigadier de Bruin, the cluster commander for Joburg.
"The second respondent (Sibiya) emphatically stated that the conduct of Aysen did not constitute a criminal offence and it was a civil matter that did not warrant the attention of a criminal court," the affidavit said.
It goes on to describe intimidating visits by SAPS and Hawks members to his business.
Two affidavits alleged Sibiya had been paid to make the Africa Cash and Carry cases go away. One said the alleged bribe was R2m.
Hathurani said Sibiya had gone to the Joburg central police station with Aysen and collected all the dockets related to the company.
Hawks spokesman Paul Ramaloko said the State had responded to all the allegations in the affidavits with responding papers, which would be filed in court this week.
The case was brought before Judge Fayeeza Kathree-Setiloane.
The matter was not heard in full last week because State advocate Naomi Manaka had not had enough time to file responding papers.
The judge granted an interim order barring the Hawks from harassing or intimidating the applicant and his attorney until the matter could be heard in full.
