The people have realised that the country has only gone backwards and has reached a stage where it cannot even compete with China. People want a party and a leader who can keep the nation's selfesteem intact Modi doesn't bow down nor does he enter into wrong pacts," the Rajasthan CM said at Aaj Tak's Seedhi Baat.
Slamming AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal's latest remarks on Modi, she said: " He Kejriwal) should have taken an appointment before meeting Modi The country needs development not anarchy." Raje added that those who are saying that industrialists and corporates are pumping money in support of Modi should also realise that the same would be contributing to India's growth story once Modi becomes the PM. " We must give Modi a chance," she said.
However, the Rajasthan CM was not convincing when she was asked on the use of chartered planes by BJP leaders. " I am using normal planes and don't think that chartered planes should be used to just travel between two states." On being asked about Modi using chartered plane, she squarely blamed the companies and the people behind it.
" Those who make it available to Modi are also responsible as this encourages corruption.
Such corruption only triggers scams like Coalgate, 2G and CWG." She also said her government in Rajasthan will soon bring her party's expenses in public domain. Coming to Congress, the CM played down the impact the party's new Rajasthan chief Sachin Pilot can have in the Lok Sabha polls.
