Ofgem said soaring household bills and intensifying public distrust highlighted the need for an investigation which will determine whether the companies are making excess profits - after they quadrupled to more than £1 billion in three years.
But British Gas owner Centrica warned that the probe, expected to last up to two years, could create uncertainty and threaten the billions of pounds worth of investment needed to keep the lights on.
Ofgem said a full-scale probe by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) would "clear the air" amid concerns that switching between suppliers had fallen and that those who never switched, many of them vulnerable customers, were being ripped off.
It also said it had found evidence of "possible tacit co-ordination" between companies on the timing and size of price announcements but stopped short of accusing them of explicitly colluding in an illegal cartel arrangement.
The CMA has extensive powers to shake up the sector which could include separating firms' generation arms from retail divisions selling gas and electricity to homes and businesses.
Retail profits increased from £233 million in 2009 to £1.1 billion in 2012, Ofgem said. It also found prices had risen by 24% over the period, well ahead of the rate of inflation at 13.8%.
Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw said he welcomed the chance to clear the air but claimed competition in the market was already intense.
