Early this month, Russian soldiers took up positions at the television transmission center here in the capital of the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Their arrival was part of a broad effort to muffle dissent over the Kremlin-backed project to guide Crimea through a swift secession from Ukraine.
Several days later, the soldiers handed over their post to a pro- secession militia. Some of these men carried whips. Technicians took the next step, removing Ukrainian networks from the air and replacing them with state-controlled channels from Moscow.
By last week, the transformation was complete. The media hub's entrance was adorned with bright flags and banners. A young woman cheerfully urged journalists to be seated for a prosecession news conference at what she now called, with a confident Orwellian flair, the Open Press Center - no matter that several television station signals had just been unplugged.
The switchover was one step in the abrupt shift in civic life on the Crimean Peninsula, where open dissent has been suppressed by the implicit threat of force. In a matter of days, the Kremlin has succeeded in recreating the constrained conditions of Russia's own civic sphere in Crimea.
With a mix of targeted intimidation, an expansive military occupation by unmistakably elite Russian units and many of the trappings of the election-season carnivals that have long accompanied rigged ballots across the old Soviet world, Crimea has been swept almost instantaneously into the Kremlin's fold.
This has happened well ahead of the referendum that was held Sunday, after which, barring an extraordinary surprise, the peninsula's interim authorities, led by a previously unsuccessful politician nicknamed the Goblin, will announce that its citizens have voted to leave Ukraine and seek a place in President Vladimir V. Putin's Russia.
On Saturday, Ukraine's government reported that the intimidation had taken a possibly more worrisome turn, saying that Russian forces had landed by helicopter to seize a gas plant just beyond the boundaries of the Crimean region. Ukrainian troops took up positions outside the gas plant, which is on a sand bar to the east of the Crimean Peninsula and south of the Ukrainian mainland, according to Unian, a Ukrainian news service, which quoted local police officers. The news agency did not say whether shots had been fired.
Russia has also massed significant forces in the regions bordering Ukraine, raising fears that it could be preparing to occupy parts of eastern or southern Ukraine.
In Crimea, the organizers of secession have relied repeatedly on strong-arm tactics, familiar to Mr. Putin's opponents at home, in order to project power to anyone who might resist a realignment of the territory.
Organizers of counterprotests have been threatened and have in some cases disappeared. Armed men in masks patrol around strategic sites.
Crimean journalists have been ordered not to describe the soldiers on their soil as Russian or to use the word ''occupation.'' And foreign and local journalists have been beaten and had their materials confiscated by uniformed men who are not officially connected to any government.
Civilian airline flights to and from Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, have been blocked. The Berkut riot police, disbanded in February under accusations of brutality by Ukraine, the state they once served, have regrouped in Crimea, where they stand as enforcers of the new authorities' will.
All the while, Ukrainian government centers are blockaded by a mix of Russian troops and men identifying themselves as their supporters.
This has played out while thickets of signs declaring ''Together with Russia'' have sprouted along roadways, urging citizens to vote to leave Ukraine.
Whether this intensive social and political pressure is even necessary is subject to debate.
Crimea, once part of Russia, has a strong historical and linguistic alignment with its Slavic neighbors to the east; many residents consider themselves Russian and approve of rejoining the revived Russian state.
But the Kremlin is taking no chances. It has ensured that most anyone who might publicly resist secession is marginalized or discouraged.
Pro-Ukraine activists have been flowing out of Crimea, frightened by an atmosphere of mounting aggression and growing indications that the police will no longer protect them.
''The security services here have gone over completely to the side of the bandits,'' said Sergei Makrenyuk, an organizer of the Crimean branch of the pro-revolutionary EuroMaidan group.
Mr. Makrenyuk, 35, fled Crimea on Tuesday, after his name and address were read out at a pro-Russia rally in his hometown, Feodosiya, with calls for the crowd to go to his house.
He said that more than a dozen other activists involved in pro-European demonstrations left the peninsula this month. ''Everyone already understands that we aren't going to be able to return,'' he said by phone on his way to Kiev with his wife and children.
Their decision was in part informed by the events of March 9, when two pro-Ukraine activists - Andriy Shchekun and Anatoliy Kovalskiy - were seized by pro-Russia militia members at Simferopol's train station.
Sergei Kovalskiy, Mr. Kovalskiy's son, said that the two men, who are prominent in the Ukrainian language and cultural movement here, were taken by people identifying themselves as members of Russian Unity, the political party headed by Crimea's new prime minister, Sergei Aksyonov.
Whether this was an arrest or an abduction depends on each Crimean's point of view.
On Monday, Mr. Aksyonov said that Crimean security forces were holding Mr. Kovalskiy for possessing large quantities of ''provocative materials.'' Mr. Kovalskiy, he added, will be held through the referendum. Then he might be set free.
''He will be released if he will not conduct undermining activity on the territory of Crimea,'' Mr. Aksyonov told the KrimInform news agency, another new feature of Crimea's news media scene, launched by Russia's state-controlled Itar-Tass.
