The findings, prompted by confidential information from a whistleblower, led Communications Security Establishment Canada to revise policy, improve training and boost oversight.
However, CSEC will say little more about the episode - leading opposition MPs to accuse the spy agency of needless secrecy as it comes under intense scrutiny due to widely publicized leaks by former American intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.
Ottawa-based CSEC monitors foreign computer, satellite, radio and telephone traffic of people, countries, organizations and terrorist cells for information of intelligence interest to the federal government.
It is a key player in the Five Eyes intelligence network that includes partner agencies from the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
The Canadian agency says its findings of asset misuse and ethics breaches are not related to national security information, the privacy of Canadians or the continuing construction of CSEC's elaborate new Ottawa headquarters.
However, the investigation led to recommendations concerning purchasing practices, asset management, and financial controls and accountability. It resulted in changes including "more rigorous training of staff and managers" and "increased monitoring of financial authorities," CSEC says.
CSEC spokesman Ryan Foreman said that for privacy reasons he could not release any information about "specific employees involved in this disclosure of wrongdoing."
