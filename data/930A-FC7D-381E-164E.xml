National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Nacada) chairman John Mututho said negotiations were in progress to bring in "highly trained" canines as Kenya was a favourite transit point for cocaine and bhang that is offloaded at airports and exported through the Mombasa port.
He said the police will handle the dogs.
"We are serious about the fight against drug abuse and that is why we are bringing in sniffer dogs," he said.
Mr Mututho also said the alcohol testing device, Alcoblow, will be taken to all the counties to help curb drink driving.
He said Kenyans were the heaviest drinkers in the region. "You will be surprised that Kenya ranks above all East African states in alcohol consumption," he said.
Speaking to journalists in Naivasha, the Nacada boss said the agency will embark on a massive campaign to test samples of locally produced alcohol to ensure standards were met.
He warned those who were not willing to have their products tested to quit the business before the law caught up with them.
"We want to ensure alcohol consumed locally meets the required standards and those preparing funny concoctions in the name of liquor should be warned," he said.
Mr Mututho also said a meeting would be held soon to discuss a recent audit report on the organisation.
The report, by the Auditor-General, reveals unexplained credits to the authority's bank accounts, unsupported expenditure, unaccounted expenses, unauthorised payments and unsurrendered alcoholic drinks fees.
