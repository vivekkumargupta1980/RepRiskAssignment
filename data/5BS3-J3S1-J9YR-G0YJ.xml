Mexican drug cartels have moved beyond drug trafficking as their main source of income, it has been revealed.
The Knights Templar cartel in western Mexico has long been known for making money from the production and transportation of drugs, such as methamphetamine, or 'crystal meth'.
But now, it has turned to illegal mining, logging and extortion for its income, according to a government official.
Today, Alfredo Castillo, a special envoy of the Mexican government in the Knights Templar-controlled state of Michoacan, said the extraction and transportation of iron ore was now the cartel's biggest moneymaker. 
'They are charging $15 (£9) [a metric ton] for the process, from extraction to transport, processing, storage, permits and finally export,' he told The Associated Press.
It has long been known that Mexican cartels, such as the Knights Templar and its predecessor, La Familia, engage in other types of criminal activity, such as the trafficking of people and pirated goods.
But this is the first time the government has acknowledgement that a major organized crime group has moved beyond drugs.
'It is a criminal organization like the mafia,' said Antonio Mazzitelli, the Mexico and Central America representative to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.
'La Familia, the Knights Templar and, in part, the new, smaller cartels that have developed, like the New Generation Jalisco, are copying this new typology.'
Mexican authorities have counted at least 12 major drug cartels now counting illegal mining, logging and extortion among their main sources of income - but also estimate there are a large number of of smaller splinter groups.
And the implications of the move are enormous - with organized crime in the general in Mexico standing to diversify and become even more entrenched.
Federal prosecutors have not seen similar shifts in other cartels, according to an Attorney General's Office official, who insisted on speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to speak about the topic.
However, experts have disagreed - citing the Zetas cartel, with its strongholds along the U.S.-Mexico border, as among the first to change the business model from merely production and transport of drugs to migrant smuggling and controlling territory through terror.
Though drugs still tops their list, the Zetas likely make as much from kidnapping and extortion, said Samuel Logan, director of Southern Pulse security consulting firm.
'I've never looked at [Mexican cartels] as drug-trafficking organizations,' he said.
'They are multinational corporations that will react to market pressures and do what they have to do to stay in business.'
The pseudo-religious Knights Templar cartel has taken the model to another level - exploiting the main industries of the territory they control.
Alonso Ancira, president of the National Chamber of the Iron and Steel, recently told local journalists that he estimated drug cartels earned $1billion (£600.75million) in profits from selling iron ore in 2013.
The federal government has issued 900 concessions in Michoacan to mine iron ore, Mr Castillo said.
In 2008, only 1.5 percent of the iron ore exports to China went through the state's port of Lazaro Cardenas, but by 2012 nearly half of the exports to the Asian country were processed there.
In relation to extortion, information from victims led government experts to estimate that the cartel earned $800,000 (£481,145) to $1.4 million (£842,000) a week just from that crime, he said.
Many of the Knights Templar's extortion demands were made on Michoacan's lime and avocado producers, while the cartel even controlled the wholesale distribution center where prices were set and growers sell limes to the rest of the world.
Former President Felipe Calderon warned against such a stranglehold when he first sent troops to Michoacan in late 2006 to fight La Familia, the predecessor of the Knights Templar.
He said the cartel was trying to infiltrate all levels of society - and by the time La Familia morphed into the Knights Templar in 2010, it seemed to control the entire state, including politicians and police who failed to act.
More than seven years of military-style strikes failed to dislodge them, but the federal government was notably more successful after targeting the cartel's financial resources.
It took over the port of Lazaro Cardenas in November and named Mr Castillo in January as a commissioner with special powers to try to clean up Michoacan.
Since then, authorities have seized 119,000 metric tons of iron ore stored at several yards in Lazaro Cardenas, as well as liberating the wholesale lime center by taking over the farming hub of Apatzingan.
The government has also arrested or killed many of the cartel's leadership, but they did the same to La Familia, only to see the cartel remake itself into something even more menacing.
Because of financial hits, the cartel is believed to now be struggling to pay informants and assassins.

During their reign, the Knights Templar's hold was so tight that vigilante groups eventually formed and armed themselves to fight back.
With fighting escalating between the cartel and the 'self-defense' groups, federal security forces finally moved in early this year.
'The Zetas, La Familia Michoacan, the Knights Templar are, for the most part, predators and parasites that become rejected by the communities,' Mr Mazzitelli said.
The Knights Templar's reception contrasts with that of traditional drug-trafficking cartels, which typically generate jobs and wealth for local people - buying loyalty and protection.
The classic example is the Sinaloa cartel, the only pure drug-trafficking organization left in Mexico.
The recent capture of its leader, Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman saw hundreds of locals line the streets to protest his arrest.
