Trevor Cosson, (pictured right) 37, of Tenterden Rise Hastings, faces 22 fraud charges relating to alleged fraudulent activity during his time working at the former Hastings and Rother Primary Care Trust as head of financial accounting.
He allegedly authorised £1.4 million worth of payments to be made to his bank account between July 2008 and August 2012.
Cosson also transferred a further £800,000 into his own bank account via email after stating the money was to be paid to St Michael's Hospice from the NHS Shared Business Services. He joined the NHS in 2001 and worked his way up to head of finance at the former Hastings and Rother Primary Care Trust.
Wearing a dark grey suit, white shirt and grey tie, Cosson spoke only to confirm his name during his brief appearance at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. Chairman of the bench Lady Ruth Lipton said: "This matter is committed to Blackfriars Crown Court and you are to get to that court at 9.30am for a preliminary hearing."
He was granted conditional bail ahead of a preliminary hearing at Blackfriars Crown Court on March 27. The PCTs ceased to exist last year and replaced by Clinical commissioning groups which are NHS organisations set up by the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to organise the delivery of NHS services in England.
