Jamie Kritzer, a spokesman for the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources, says none of the inspectors who went to the site March 11 reported seeing the crack. The state did not know about the crack until Duke decided March 20 to repair it and notified the state about its plans.
But he noted inspectors on the scene March 11 were with the Division of Water Quality. The dam inspection was performed Feb. 21, and at that time there was no sign of the crack, Kritzer says.
Duke (NYSE:DUK) declines to comment.
Critics unsatisfied
The damaged dam forms the largest ash pond at the Cape Fear plant. The dam was built in 1985. DENR says Duke repaired it early this week. DENR says the dam's structural integrity was not threatened by the damage.
The recent inspections were triggered by the Feb. 2 ash spill at Duke's Dan River Steam Station. A stormwater pipe under the main ash pond at the plant broke and spewed up to 39,000 tons of coal ash into the Dan. DENR resolved to conduct new intensive inspections at all 14 of Duke's active and retired coal plants in North Carolina.
The alliance took aerial pictures at the plant on March 10, which showed Duke was pumping water out of the dam into local streams. It now has published additional pictures that show the crack was clearly visible that day.
DENR's explanation for its inspectors' actions at the Cape Fear ash pond dam does not mollify critics. Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette thinks the situation, at best, demonstrates a lack of communication among divisions at DENR and the way regulators are stretched thin by budget cuts.
At worst, he sees it as demonstrating continued cozy relationships between Duke and regulators, with DENR laying back and letting Duke decide when there are problems rather than aggressively enforcing state regulations.
He notes dam inspectors learned about the pumping in February but did not tell anyone in the Division of Water Quality. And he believes water-quality inspectors may have seen the crack but did not tell anyone in dam safety.
"This is a great example of how changes in the way DENR operates are failing North Carolina," Burdette says. "We have the new 'customer culture' there and at the same time the budget is cut and the number of regulators on the ground is slashed."
The photos show the crack, although it was not yet so large as it would be when Duke decided it needed patching.
Rick Dove, the photographer who took the aerial photos, estimated the crack to be 12 to 20 feet long. "I would say 15 feet is as good an estimate as any," he says.
Duke told DENR that if first noticed the crack in early March. It appeared small and Duke personnel decided to just keep an eye on it. But later in the month, it began to grow rapidly.&nbsp; When it got to 35 feet long, Duke decided it needed repair, and the company notified DENR.
Kritzer notes that state law does not require the keeper of a dam to inform DENR when it discovers a crack. The law does not require notice unless the dam's owner decides to make repairs. Then the owner is to start repairs but inform DENR immediately, so it can consult on doing the repairs properly.
That is what Duke did. Kritzer says when DENR's dam inspector returned to the site March 21, the crack had grown to 40 feet in length. It was as much as four inches wide, Kritzer says.
Kritzer says DENR's concern was that the crack was pushing the earth below it out into the ash pond and was bending back a "riser" pipe in the pond.
Risers are vertical pipes that attach to a horizontal pipe which goes under the dam to release excess water. They are designed to siphon the cleanest water off the top of the pond when the water rises. The sediment containing the coal ash settles out of the water, and is found at its higher concentrations the farther down you go in the pond.
Kritzer says DENR feared the pressure from the shifting dam would crack the pipe and cause a leak of ash-laden water into the local tributary and out into the river.
That's Burdette's fear as well. "If there is a break in the pipe under the dam, that would be essentially what you saw at the Dan River," he says.
Dove says he did not notice the crack when he was originally taking the pictures.
"When you are flying 120 miles an hour up at 1,000 feet, there are things your eyes won't pick up," he says. "The camera is your friend. It sees things your eyes don't."
After reports of the crack in the dam came out, Dove says people in the alliance asked him to go back through the pictures more carefully. He said he took some time because he took more than 1,000 photographs. He was able to find several shots that showed the crack clearly.
He also returned to the site on March 23 and took aerial photographs of the repairs done by Duke. The repairs were obviously done in the area where the March 10 photos showed the crack.
Kritzer says he does not believe the water-quality inspectors who went to the site March 11 noticed the crack. They were focused on collecting water samples and noting conditions at the discharge points where the five ponds release water into local tributaries of the Cape Fear River, he says.
And their attention was immediately drawn by the fact that Duke had significantly reduced the water level in two of the ponds and had two portable pumps on site. Shortly after the inspections, DENR cited Duke for illegally dumping 61 million gallons of water from the ponds into a service canal that carried the water into an unnamed tributary of the Cape Fear River, and from there on to the river itself.
That pumping occurred over several months, starting in September. Duke says it notified DENR in August that it planned to pump water out of the dams to perform routine maintenance on the risers. DENR confirms it was told about the maintenance work. But it contends the volume of water pumped out far exceeded what would be normal for the maintenance required.
Dove's March 10 photos show the crack right next to one of the pumps that DENR inspectors saw March 11 at the site. But when Dove took the pictures, the pumps were operating. On March 11, they were shut off and had been detached from the lines feeding into the ponds and to the pipes that discharge water into the canal. Kritzer says they may not have been in the same positions they were on March 10 when Dove took the original photos.
