The decision of the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) to draw a 400kv power line from Yelawal in Mysore to Kasaragod in Kerala via Kodagu, has drawn the ire of locals who say the project will see as many as 50,000 trees felled, affecting the ecology and increasing man-animal conflict.
Protests were held simultaneously in Mandya, Gejjalagere, Maddur, Srirangapatna and Pandavapura towns. Farmers raised slogans against the state and Union government of their hell-bent attitude towards destroying the Kodagu forest. They
accused state home minister K J George and Union minister A K Antony of being hand in glove with the timber mafia.
Farmer leader K S Nanjundegowda alleged that vested interests have been striving hard to implement the project. "Any human interference in the highly sensitive ecological zone can be catastrophic to the flora and fauna. Kodagu forest is the birth place of Cauvery river. If we lose the greenery, there won't be rain. Can any government provide thousands of TMC of water for irrigation, drinking purpose to more than nine crore people if the forests are destroyed," Nanjundegowda asked.
Ryot leader K S Nanjuendegowda, Shambunahalli Suresh and Haniyambadi Nagaraju and other leaders participated in protests.
