WASHINGTON | The oil company behind the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history can once again perform work for the federal government.
Under an agreement reached Thursday with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, more than two dozen BP entities and its Houston-based oil production and exploration arm can secure new government contracts.
The company had been suspended from performing any new government work since November 2012, after BP agreed to plead guilty and to pay a $4.5 billion fine for criminal charges involving the deaths of 11 workers and lying to Congress about how much oil was spilling into the Gulf of Mexico.

U.S.: rights treaty doesn't apply to us
The Obama administration declared Thursday that a global Bill of Rights-style treaty imposes no human rights obligations on U.S. military and intelligence forces when they operate abroad, rejecting an interpretation by the United Nations and the top State Department lawyer during President Barack Obama's first term.
The administration affirmed that stance in a meeting in Geneva of the U.N. Human Rights Committee.

Bin Laden son-in-law got wind of a plan
Osama bin Laden's son-in-law and al-Qaida spokesman said he heard before the Sept. 11 attacks that "something big was going to happen" but didn't know what it was, an FBI agent testified Thursday.
Sulaiman Abu Ghaith told authorities that when he visited al-Qaida training camps in summer 2001, he gleaned that something major was in the works but never learned that the group had specific plans, Agent Michael Butsch testified at Abu Ghaith's federal trial in New York.
Abu Ghaith is the highest-ranking al-Qaida figure to be tried on U.S. soil since 9/11.
