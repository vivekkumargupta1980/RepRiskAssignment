Of the 31 bids the energy giant has submitted for crude oil and natural gas licences, 24 of its offers were the highest received, according to Tommy Beaudreau, director of the US Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.
The licences are part of a US government auction of rights to drill in a 40macre area off the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
BP's bids come just a week after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lifted a ban on the company applying for federal contracts, introduced after the Deepwater Horizon rig that BP was using in the Gulf suffered an accident in 2010 that killed 11 workers, ruined local businesses and caused the biggest marine disaster in US history.
The EPA argued that BP had added insult to injury by displaying an alleged "lack of business integrity" in its handling of the matter.
BP is the second-largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico after Shell, producing 63m barrels last year. In 2009 BP produced 182m barrels in the area.
