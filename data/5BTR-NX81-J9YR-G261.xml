The struggling lender said it needed to raise a further £400m from investors after revealing its losses for last year could be as high as £1.3bn following the discovery of hundreds of hundreds of millions of pounds of new compensation costs.
Niall Booker, chief executive of the Co-op Bank, said the capital raise probably meant plans for an initial public offering of the business were "some way off", adding that a series of reports into failure at the lender did not "present a perfect backdrop to an IPO".
The Co-op Bank had said it hoped to list this year, but the requirement to set aside about £400m for compensation claims related to PPI, interest rate swap mis-selling, mortgages, as well as "technical breaches" of the Consumer Credit Act have effectively killed this plan.
The new fund-raising will be unwelcome news to the Co-op Group, which owns a 30pc stake in the bank, following last year's debt-for-equity swap that saw the troubled mutual give up control of the lender to its bondholders after a £1.5bn capital hole led to a race to save the business.
If the Co-op were to take up its full allocation of rights it would cost the mutual £120m, but given its own financial problems it is far from clear it will play its full part in the capital-raising.
Mr Booker said the Co-op Bank had already planned with its advisers at UBS for the eventuality that its former parent was unable to take part.
"If the Co-op doesn't take up its share, UBS is pretty happy that it can be placed elsewhere," he said.
A spokesman for the Co-op said: "As a shareholder in the bank we will consider our position in relation to the proposed additional capital raising and make a further statement as and when appropriate."
The Co-op Bank had said its capital raising would take its core Tier 1 capital ratio, the main measure of a lender's financial strength, to just below 9pc, but the new provisions and losses mean it is expected to have ended 2013 at 7.2pc, close to the regulatory minimum of 7pc.
The lender will give more details of the cash call and its finances with the release of its annual report and accounts on April 8. Talks have already been held with investors about the fund raising, though because of secrecy requirements none were given advanced warning of the announcement.
"We have one or two grumpy investors, but I don't think it's a surprise that we have had to raise some more capital. We always felt the original amounts were tight," said Mr Booker.
Some of the bondholders that held debt at the time of the equity swap have already exited their positions amid fears over the bank's future.
"I have avoided investing here because I am wary of more land mines," said one former investor in the Co-op Bank.
Mr Booker said he was unable to guarantee there could not be further cash calls on shareholders, but said he hoped the worst was behind the business.
"Nobody is ever going to say there is not an outside possibility [of a further capital raising], but this is our best analysis," he said.
The Treasury select committee has held a series of public hearings to quiz former directors and executives of the lender on its near failure, as well as senior regulators and bankers.
The Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), Britain's two main financial watchdogs, are conducting their own reviews in to the bank's problems, and the Treasury is expected to produce its own report once these reviews have been completed.
The PRA, which is run by the Bank of England, is not understood to have played any part in pushing the Co-op Bank to launch its new capital raising.
