In 2002, Anwar Ibrahim's IIIT was included in a lawsuit by victims of 9/11 seeking damages from organizations linked to 'rendering material support to radical Islamism.' In 2003, US government prosecutors 'submitted court documents detailing financial support (PDF) from the IIIT for convicted Palestinian Islamic Jihad fundraiser Sami al-Arian.' They also found that Taha Jaber al-Alwani, the president of IIIT had once stated via a fatwa that 'jihad is the only way to liberate Palestine.'
