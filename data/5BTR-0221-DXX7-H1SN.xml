Malcolm Fyfield was the sole survivor of the Gleision mining disaster near Pontardawe, south Wales, in 2011.
He managed to crawl out of a flooded mine shaft after a sudden deluge of water killed Charles Breslin, 62, Philip Hill, 44, Garry Jenkins, 39, and David Powell, 50.
Father-of-two Fyfield denies four counts of manslaughter, while MNS Mining Ltd, which operated the pit at the time, has pleaded not guilty to four charges of corporate manslaughter.
Fyfield and two representatives of MNS appeared at Swansea Crown Court yesterday, when an initial pool of potential jurors were selected.
Judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams said the trial is set to last at least four months, and more than 90 witnesses are expected to give evidence. end
