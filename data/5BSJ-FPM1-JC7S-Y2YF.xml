The Sofia municipality, which is the sole owner of Toplofikatsia Sofia heating utility, has failed to come up with any constructive proposals for covering  its outstanding payments to BEH's fully-owned subsidiary Bulgargaz for the natural gas it has bought from it, BEH said in a press release.
In order to ensure the provision of heating services to the residents of the capital city, which requires gas, and in the absence of any action or payment proposals, BEH was forced to buy a new batch of Toplofikatsia Sofia debt, it added.
BEH incorporates assets of Bulgaria's sole nuclear power plant Kozloduy, gas monopoly Bulgargaz, gas transmission system operator Bulgartransgaz, telecommunications operator Bulgartel, the National Electricity Company and its wholly-owned system operator Electricity System Operator, coal-fired power plant Maritsa East 2 and the Maritsa East coal mines.
