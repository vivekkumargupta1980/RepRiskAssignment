The First Intermediate People's Court of Beijing notified the lawyer of its decision to accept the suit filed by 40 plaintiffs, including bereaved families of people forcibly taken to Japan during the war by Nippon Coke & Engineering Co. , formerly Mitsui Mining Co., and Mitsubishi Materials Corp. .
The plaintiffs have demanded that the two companies pay one million yuan per person and issue an apology.
This is the first time that a Chinese court has accepted a lawsuit against wartime forced labor in Japan. The acceptance is expected to encourage similar lawsuits to follow, people familiar with the matter said.
The decision by Chinese President Xi Jinping's leadership to allow the trial to proceed would affect the relationship between Japan and China, they added.
Submitting a written complaint on Feb. 26, the plaintiffs claim that the Japanese government and the two companies abused human rights as they were responsible for the use of forced labor, though they did not sue the government.
Japan's Supreme Court ruled in April 2007 that individual rights to claims over wartime forced labor in Japan were abandoned when China relinquished its right to seek compensation under the 1972 Japan-China joint communique for bilateral diplomatic normalization.
Following the joint statement, the Japanese government said that there was no dispute over China's right to claim war-related compensation.
According to the plaintiffs' lawyer, the trial is expected to begin in several months.
