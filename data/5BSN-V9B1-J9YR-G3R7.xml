Of the 31 bids the oil giant has submitted for crude oil and natural gas licences, 24 were the highest, according to Tommy Beaudreau, director of the Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.
The leases are part of a US government auction of rights to drill in a 40m-acre area off the coast of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
BP's bids come just a week after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lifted a ban on the company applying for federal contracts, introduced after its Macondo well exploded in 2010, killing 11 workers, ruining local businesses and causing the biggest marine disaster in US history.
The EPA argued that BP had added insult to injury by displaying an alleged "lack of business integrity" in its handling of the matter.
BP is the second largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico after Shell, producing 63m barrels last year. But that is well down on levels seen before the disaster; in 2009 BP produced 182m barrels in the area.
