Furthermore, Croatia claims that in this case MOL will have to reimburse the government in Zagreb with billions of Croat kuna for the lost profits.
Earlier in 2014, Croatian deputy economy minister Alen Leveric said that Croatia has filed a lawsuit at the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), asking to cancel the 2009 amendments to the contract on INA's management rights and the main contract on the gas operations. Croatia also asked a compensation for the damages, which it claims has suffered because of these contracts, signed on Jan 30, 2009 during the mandate of Ivo Sanader as a prime minister.
The demands are based on Sanader's 2012 jail sentence for bribe taking during INA's privatisaion by MOL, among other issues. Therefore, Croatia believes the amendments of the shareholders agreement took place in corruption circumstances. Hungary, however, does not recognise the sentence.
The tensions between the two sides intensified in September 2013 after the Croatian police issued an arrest warrant for MOL's CEO Zsolt Hernadi, accusing him of bribing Sanader in exchange for gaining management rights in INA. In return, the Hungarian government asked MOL's management to review its portfolio and, if necessary, prepare the sale of its INA stake.
MOL, which is 24.6% owned by the Hungarian state, is the largest single shareholder in INA. The Croatian government follows with 44.85%.
