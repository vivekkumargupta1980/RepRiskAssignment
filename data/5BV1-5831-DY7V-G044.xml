Defense Minister El-Sisi, 59, must leave the army to run in the presidential election, expected to be held later this year.
Quoting a military source, Al-Ahram said the meeting would determine a successor to the field marshal. He is expected to submit his resignation to interim President Adly Mansour at a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Al-Ahram said.
El-Sisi deposed President Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's first freely elected leader, last year following mass protests against the latter's rule.
The officer is popular among Egyptians who supported the army's decision to remove Morsy from power a year into his term -- seeing him as the kind of strong man needed to end the turmoil dogging Egypt since a popular uprising ended Hosni Mubarak's three decades of one-man rule in 2011.
But El-Sisi is reviled by the Islamist opposition, which sees him as the mastermind of a coup against an elected leader and author of a fierce crackdown on dissent.
Egypt has suffered bloody internal strife since Morsy was overthrown.
On Wednesday, police clashed with protesters at Cairo University who were demonstrating against a court's decision to sentence 529 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood to death.
Monday's court ruling drew widespread criticism from international human rights groups.
