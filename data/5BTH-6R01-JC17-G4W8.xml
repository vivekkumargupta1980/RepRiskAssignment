Nearly 100 people attended Tuesday's meeting of Middlesex supervisors to speak against the drill pad, proposed for a site off Denny Road on the Geyer farm property, about 4,000 feet from the school district's campus.
Middlesex Manager Scott Fodi said that as long as the drilling is allowed under local zoning regulations, approval must come from the DEP. Fodi said the area already is zoned to allow for drilling.
"The DEP approves the site location, and its setback from all adjacent features "” structures, regardless of occupancy, wetlands/streams or any other natural feature," Fodi said in an email statement.
Rex Energy expects to submit paperwork for the permit application to the DEP within the next few weeks, company officials said. The company sent out notices to residents living within 3,000 feet of the proposed well pad, government officials and water suppliers, as required by state law.
Area residents have campaigned against the well, saying that no drilling should be conducted that close to school property. A gas well explosion in Greene County on Feb. 11 that killed one worker increased their concern.
A petition on change.org, signed by more than 300 people as of Thursday, calls for a ban within a two-mile radius of school property, saying it would protect 3,000 Mars school students.
The Mars Area School Board on March 11 rejected Rex's offer to pay the district $1 million plus royalties to drill underneath school property.
The DEP must issue a drilling permit within 45 days of submission if the application meets all requirements, spokeswoman Lisa Kasianowitz said. The DEP considers how far the well is from buildings and water supplies, whether an operator has a bond and the control-and-disposal plan for drilling waste.
Since 1800, the state has processed 16,353 unconventional well permit applications, according to the DEP. Of those, 362 applications have been returned, withdrawn or rejected, the agency said.
