I visited Israel and the West Bank with a group of Canadians in November 2013 and saw first-hand the discriminatory and oppressive policies and legislation aimed at Palestinians and non-Jews in Israel. We spoke to members of the Knesset, a Jewish and British journalist and a number of community activists, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Israel may call itself a democracy but it has more than 42 laws that discriminate against non-Jews on matters of property ownership, education, employment, marriage and movement.
To say that Israel and Canada are very alike on the matter of protection of human rights is misguided and inaccurate. Apartheid means separation. There are many examples of apartheid in present-day Israel; the illegal concrete wall on illegally occupied Palestinian territories being the most blatant.
Mr. Harper does not speak for all Canadians on the Israel- Palestine issue. Many of my friends and colleagues were upset at the statements he made when in Israel because they didn't present a balanced view of Canadian opinion.
I strongly support the University of Windsor undergraduate students' motion in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. I encourage other student unions to do the same. The BDS movement is not anti-Semitic but is a strategy to exert pressure on Israel to honestly address and solve the human rights issues in Israel and the West Bank. There will not be peace in the Middle East until this is done.
