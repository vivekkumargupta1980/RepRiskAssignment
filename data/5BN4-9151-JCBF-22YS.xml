The plants don’t have federal permits to discharge stormwater, according to the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The alleged violations were issued late Friday, according to the agency.
They follow two additional allegations earlier Friday of violations at the Dan River power plant in Rockingham County, where a collapsed stormwater pipe running beneath a coal ash pond sent up to 39,000 tons of the material into the river and about 27 million gallons of water.
The five plants alleged to be at fault: Belews Creek Steam Station in Rockingham County, Cliffside Steam Station in Rutherford County, Lee Steam Electric Plant in Wayne County, Roxboro Steam Electric Power Plant in Person County and Sutton Steam Electric Plant in New Hanover County.
Duke will be given an opportunity to respond to the allegations.
The sudden crackdown on the Duke coal ash plants not only follows the massive spill, but comes amid environmental advocates’ criticism of DENR’s regulation of the sites, and a federal criminal grand jury investigation of the relationship between Duke and DENR.
