The lower effective tax rate reflected the geographical distribution of our profit, the non-taxable gain on profits resulting from the reclassification of our holding in Industrial Bank as a financial investment and the disposal of our operations in Panama and our investment in Ping An. The tax expense decreased by US$0.6bn to US$4.8bn despite a US$2.0bn increase in accounting profit before tax, due to the combination of benefits noted above and because the 2012 tax expense included the non-tax deductible effect of fines and penalties paid as part of the settlement of investigations into past inadequate compliance with anti-money laundering and sanction laws. In 2013, the tax borne and paid by the Group to the relevant tax authorities, including tax on profits, bank levy and employer-related taxes, was US$8.6bn (2012: US$9.3bn). The amount differs from the tax charge reported in the income statement due to indirect taxes such as VAT and the bank levy included in pre-tax profit, and the timing of payments. We also play a major role as tax collector for governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such taxes include employee-related taxes and taxes withheld from payments to deposit holders. In 2013, we collected US$8.8bn (2012: US$8.5bn).
