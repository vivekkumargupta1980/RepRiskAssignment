The future of the scandal-hit Co-operative Group was in crisis today after it emerged that the company has been weighed down by with 'debt' and riddled with bad 'governance'.
Financial expert Lord Paul Myners, has spent the past three months been compiling a report on the company.
In a scathing conclusion on the state of the company, the former Financial Services Secretary branded the organisation 'reckless'.
The Labour peer warned that the company had been run with a 'dealmaking' mindset by undemocratic board members with limited business knowledge.
Lord Myners said that unless governance at the company was radically changed, the group could run out of money to keep its businesses afloat.
He said that the company had been in decline for more than half a century and blamed the governance system for its demise.
In an exclusive interview with The Guardian he said: 'The rate of deterioration has increased over the last half dozen years because of the recklessness of the strategy being pursued and supported by the board.'
Mr Myners added that the Co-operative Group, which prides itself on values such as openness and social responsibility, was not a democratic organisation.
The group has been engulfed in scandal over the past 12 months. In November, an expose by the Mail on Sunday revealed former non-executive director of the Co-Operative bank, Paul Flowers, purchasing cocaine.
Mr Flowers, formerly a Methodist minister, had resigned from the group six months prior to the scandal, over criticism of alleged lavish expenses.
Another high-profile resignation occurred earlier this week when Euan Sutherland, chief executive of the Co-operative Group stepped down.
Just days before his resignation on Monday, Mr Sutherland had lashed out on Facebook against fellow board members for leaking details of his £3.7 million pay package.
Lord Myners warned that the future of the retail group, funeral home, pharmacy and farming arm of the company, would all suffer if the group's culture did not radically change.
He blamed the Co-operative bank's demise on its directors, who he said allowed senior managers to squander billions on corporate transactions.
He added that poor decisions were made because of the directors' lack of business knowledge.
Elected directors at the company include a plasterer, a lecturer, a tax official a nurse and a farmer.
Lord Myners described deals such as the takeover of the Somerfield supermarket chain and the Britannia building society as 'destructive'.
The Britannia takeover left the Co-op bank with £1.5bn of debt which resulted in the bank being bought out by a U.S. hedge fund.
The purchase of both companies had not boosted the value of the business, Lord Myners added.
In a report on the group released this week, the director concluded that the Co-operative had been left in a vulnerable position because of its governance.
Although the Co-operative is owned by its employees, Lord Myners said that they have no say in decisions made by managers or by the company's board.
Despite the criticism, he described Mr Sutherland's resignation as tragic and said that the group's survival had been down to his governance.
Lord Myners, who has had experience as ex-chairman of Marks & Spencer and of the Guardian Media Group said that the company's governance was the worst that he had witnessed during his career.
He has spent the past three months analysing the organisation's structure - but the payment for his work will total just £1.
He said that he hoped that by restructuring the company, the Co-op would become a more democratic workplace.
Lord Myners also plans to ensure that senior roles are held by individuals with business experience.
