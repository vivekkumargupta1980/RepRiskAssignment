Fang Fang, who has spent more than a decade at JPMorgan, most recently as chief executive for China investment banking and a vice-chairman for Asia investment banking, had "informed us of his desire to retire", Therese Esperdy, JPMorgan's co-head of banking for Asia-Pacific, said in the memo.
Since last year, JPMorgan has been the subject of a US bribery investigation into whether the bank's "sons and daughters" hiring programme violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by linking the employment of the children of senior Chinese officials and business leaders to investment banking deals. Fang has not been accused of wrongdoing as a result of the investigation.
