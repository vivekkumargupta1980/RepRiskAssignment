But critics say this targeting of small-time criminals fails to confront the biggest culprits in oil thefts: the politically connected criminal cartels who sell on the international market.
Similar missions in the past have failed to slow thefts valued at more than $20 million (R213m) a day on the world market.
On Friday night, the commanding officer of the NNS Delta, Captain Musa Gemu, said sailors destroyed about 260 refineries in the Warri area of the southern Niger Delta. He said they also arrested five suspects.
A former militant in the area, Cross Ebikpade, said such attacks had little effect as the primitive operations used materials like oil drums that were easily available locally. "You can burn the site today, but by next week the operators are back in business," he said.
Niger Delta residents said they felt entitled to steal oil because they had received little reparation for decades of oil spills and gas flaring that had corrupted their environment, killing fishing and agricultural fields.
Director Patrick Dele Cole of Stop the Theft, an advocacy group, estimated thefts at 250 000 barrels a day - more than a tenth of the country's daily production of 2.2 million barrels. He said the thefts would not end until authorities addressed the fact that profits benefited the same generals and politicians who were ordering the raids.
Another non-government group, the Stakeholders Democracy Network, published a report in October alleging a small group of senior military officials charged with halting the thefts actually had shares in syndicates that were stealing crude. Lower-ranking officers demanded large bribes to allow boats carrying stolen crude to leave the country, the network said.
Dele Cole said "the whole idea of selling oil illegally was sponsored and maintained by our political leaders" to fund election campaigns.
With Nigeria gearing up for hotly contested elections in February next year, it's unlikely there will be any political will to halt the thefts soon.
Graft at the highest levels is endemic in Nigeria. The oil thefts are unrelated to some 20 billion petrodollars allegedly missing from the country's treasury, from oil sold between January 2012 and July last year.
