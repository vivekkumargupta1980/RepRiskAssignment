British paper Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday that a former vice-president of the ruling body FIFA, Jack Warner, appears to have received 1.2 million dollars from a company owned by former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam of Qatar in 2011. The report said Warner requested the payment in December 2010 through one of his companies, 'for work carried out between 2005 and 2010', two weeks after Qatar were elected 2022 hosts by the FIFA executive committee. An additional 1 million dollars were allegedly paid to two of Warner's sons and an employee, the report said, adding that Warner and his family declined to comment on the accusations. Qatar World Cup organizers said in the report they are 'unaware of any allegations surrounding business dealings between private individuals' and insisted that 'the 2022 bid committee strictly adhered to FIFA's bidding regulations in compliance with their code of ethics.'
