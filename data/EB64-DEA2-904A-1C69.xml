Mar 13, 2014 (ACTmedia News:http://actmedia.eu Delivered by Newstex) Friday, March 14, 2014 Intra-Community trading of spoiled meat products prejudice national security, the inquiry file drafted by the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) garnering the support of the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), the latter initiating the action to combat the criminal acts since last year, said Sorin Sava, the spokesperson for SRI in a statement for Agerpres.
'This case is initiated by SRI since the beginning of 2013 and is part of a series of efforts of the Service to combat tax evasion that implicitly affects the consolidated budget of the Romanian state. It is evident that it's a matter of national security in the economic security and cross-border threats domains' said Sorin Sava on Thursday.He added that on the basis of data and information, SRI notified law enforcement agencies, specifically the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) and offered support in the inquiry.Sava said that the network is a complex one, having contacts abroad as well.'We are talking about an organized crime ring specialized in large scale tax fraud, mainly through intra-Community trading in meat products. The individuals also had contacts abroad' added Sorin Sava.DIICOT prosecutors have issued detainment orders for a 24-hour period for ten persons accused in the tax evasion and commercialization of spoiled meat case, the detained persons will face a court with proposals for preventive custody.Up to now, 37 persons have been questioned at DIICOT's headquarters but the hearings have not finished yet.Wednesday, DIICOT prosecutors together with judicial police officers searched 102 homes in 18 counties as part of actions seeking to disband two groups of 80 persons, specialized in tax evasion, money laundering, commercializing spoiled products and influence peddling.According to DIICOT, the members of the groups would acquire through firms in Romania mainly meat and eggs from EU member states: Netherlands, Poland, Great Britain, Germany without paying VAT - according to legal procedures (a real operation inscribed in accounting documents), the merchandise being sold to the final beneficiary with VAT added.After the real purchase of merchandise from other EU states, the members of the group would inscribe fictitious deliveries to 'ghost' firms in other Community states - coordinated by the contacts abroad, as of yet unidentified.The merchandise in Romania was delivered 'on paper' to Bulgaria, Hungary and Cyprus so the Romanian firm would not be charged VAT, the merchandise in fact was sold on the Romanian market without being inscribed in accounting documents.There is also the suspicion that the network would purchase merchandise from the intra-Community market without paying VAT (Netherlands, Poland, Great Britain, Germany) directly through 'ghost' firms and would sell it on the internal black market at a price close to that of the merchandise with VAT, however far lower than market prices, fact which would constitute unfair competition to the firms that operate the same type of business in a legal manner.Investigators declared that there are also suspicions of spoiled products being sent to butcheries to be processed and mixed with other products that were later marketed as well as suspicions of spoiled meat being used, prepared and put into circulation by a catering company owned by the wife of one of the members of the group.After the beginning of DIICOT's investigation, inspectors of the National Authority for Consumer Protection recalled 229 tons of meat and meat products and imposed fines of 71,500 lei on the economic operators as part of checks carried out on Wednesday.
