(KG - TSX Venture), ("Klondike" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it is proceeding with its proposal to acquire a majority interest in the issued and outstanding shares of Klondike Star Mineral Corporation ("KSMC"), a widely held, private Delaware company, announced in the Company's news release of March 1, 2012. Klondike Gold is offering each shareholder of KSMC the opportunity to exchange each share of KSMC they hold for 0.25 Klondike Gold shares. This Offer to Exchange (the "Offer") is subject to shareholders of KSMC tendering for exchange a minimum of 51% of the outstanding shares of KSMC. With a total of 68,653,461 shares of KSMC issued and outstanding, Klondike Gold may issue up to 17,163,365 shares if 100% of the shares of KSMC are tendered for exchange.
Klondike Gold's principal focus has been the exploration and development of a group of 974 quartz claims situated in the Yukon and covering an area of approximately 185 square kilometres, including claims underlying a large part of the Bonanza-Eldorado Creeks catchment area credited with providing over 50% of the historic alluvial (placer) gold production from the Klondike gold field. Klondike Gold holds a 22.5% interest in these claims directly and another 50% interest is held by Lonestar Gold Inc., a private company, which is 80% owned by Klondike Gold.
KSMC's principal assets are its holdings of the remaining interests in these 974 quartz claims, 27.5% of which it holds directly, along with a 20% interest in Lonestar Gold Inc. Additionally, KSMC owns directly a further 368 quartz claims covering an area of approximately 61 square kilometres that are adjacent and/or contiguous to the base group of 974 quartz claims.
The objective of the Offer is to acquire control of KSMC and thereby consolidate the title to this package of a total of 1,342 quartz claims covering approximately 246 square kilometres part of which underlie 70% of the Bonanza-Eldorado Creeks catchment area of the historic Klondike gold fields to enhance the ability to finance the further development of these claims.
In addition to the interest in the quartz claims described above, KSMC also holds title to 188 placer claims in the Yukon extending approximately 60 miles along the Indian River at the confluence with Montana Creek, subject to a 5% gross production royalty payable by KSMC to the vendors. In 2012, by way of a Royalty and Lease Agreement, KSMC granted an exclusive lease of the claims and the mining rights thereto, including the water licence and the mining permit held by KSMC, to Klondike Gold.
Peter Tallman, President and CEO of Klondike Gold, commented: "Klondike Gold's vision to create a successful exploration enterprise in the Yukon first requires consolidation of the property titles into one business entity. The addition into Klondike Gold's portfolio of KSMC's interests in the key Bonanza-Eldorado area mineral claims, as well as the other KSMC mineral claims nearby, plus the alluvial placer claims creates a combination with the threshold needed to attain that vision."
The offer is being made by Klondike Gold as an exempt take-over bid under Canadian securities regulations and is subject to acceptance for filing by the TSX Venture Exchange.
