According to a joint statement of the two Ukrainian ministries, the seizure of the Roshen factory in Lipetsk by Russian law-enforcement officers on March 19 is the continuation of a politically motivated campaign against the Ukrainian investor when in summer 2013 Rosselkhoznadzor introduced a ban on the supply of Roshen products from Ukraine.
"Representatives of Russian law-enforcement agencies did not present any documents that allow them to enter the territory of the enterprise and suspend production. The top managers of Roshen company did not receive any official reports or warnings which could have been a preconditions for the illegal interference in their operations," reads the statement.
"There are all grounds to believe that Russian authorities have actually started to seize the production facilities of Roshen Corporation located in Russia and have violated the fundamental principle of the inviolability of private property guaranteed by international laws, in particular, Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 35 of the Constitution of Russian Federation," reads the statement.
According to the document, despite Russian aggression in Crimea, which is the integral part of Ukraine, new Ukrainian authorities respect rights of Russian investors.
"We demand the same attitude to Ukrainian investors in Russia," reads the statement.
