In a letter sent to the Chief Justice, the HRCP chairperson said that
business interests in complicity with officials of the Karachi Metropolitan
Corporation (KMC) had started construction of multiple flyovers and underpasses around the Clifton seafront without any prior notice.
She said that such a major venture which would vandalize the very face of a historical part of the city, has not undergone the Environmental Impact
Assessment (with public hearings) mandated by law.
The chairperson highlighted HRCP's deep concern over the adverse impact that this project could have on the more than 150 years old Sri Ratneswar Mahadev temple located within a few meters of one of the underpasses.
She said that every year thousands of Hindu and Sikh devotees visited the temple located in a cavern under the Jehangir Kothari Parade.
Ground vibrations from excavation and from the eventual high-density
traffic running so close to the temple could cause collapse of this irreplaceable place of worship, the HRCP chairperson added.
She said that the Hindu community in Sindh had been experiencing escalating human rights violations over the past few years. The Laxmi Narayan Mandir, located at Native Jetty, near the Jinnah Bridge on M.A. Jinnah Road, had its access, privacy and environs severely affected a few years ago by another commercial project, Port Grand.
The letter called upon the Chief Justice to summon KMC officials to explain the matter and ensure that all necessary steps were taken to protect the temple, said the press release issued here on Friday
