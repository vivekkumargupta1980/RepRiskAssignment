The Hunter Thoroughbred Breeders Association reminded the NSW government it had a duty of care to residents in a strongly worded statement before the NSW Planning Assessment Commission, sitting in Muswellbrook today to consider intensification of coal extraction from Mangoola.
"The Hunter Valley has more than 30, mostly open-cut, coalmines and six active coal-fired power stations," association vice-president Andrew Wiles wrote in the statement.
The Mangoola intensification will increase dust levels by 22 per cent, provide for mine water discharges ito the Hunter River in some circumstances, employ 200 extra workers and increase extraction from 10.5 million tonnes per year to 13.5 million tonnes.
The association reserved some of its strongest criticism for a NSW planning process that allowed mines to seek multiple "modifications" to approvals.
The current Mangoola proposal is the sixth modification since its controversial approval in 2007 when it was known as Anvil Hill mine.
"Taken in isolation [Mangoola] can argue the alterations, modifications and extensions are relatively small changes," Mr Wiles said. "Taken together they represent a significant change to the company's mining operations and the impact on local communities."
NSW Greens MP and health spokesman John Kaye said the 22 per cent dust increase was completely unacceptable, and research showed it would lead to an increase in lung diseases and serious health outcomes.
Mangoola did not respond to emailed questions.
