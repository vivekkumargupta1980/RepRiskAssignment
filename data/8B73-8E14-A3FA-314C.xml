Union members, students and political groupings rallied under umbrella organisation the Nelson Mandela Bay Palestine Solidarity Alliance (NMBPSA) for the protest. They said they were drawing attention to G4S's involvement in the running of Israeli "prisons, torture centres and detention facilities". Solidarity alliance member Janet Cherry said: "The company G4S has a big presence in Port Elizabeth, but we want to make people aware of their activities globally. "Maybe if they knew what was happening, more people would rather boycott them. "They don't have the monopoly on security in Port Elizabeth - people have other options." The turnout for yesterday's picket was not high. Employees of G4S Port Elizabeth referred all questions to their national office, which could not be reached for comment.
