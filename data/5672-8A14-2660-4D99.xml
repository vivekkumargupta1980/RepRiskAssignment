Fonterra violated four provisions of the law, according to the Ministry of Primary Industries. The company said it was accepting the charges, which could lead to a fine of as much as NZ$500,000 (US$427,780). Last year, it recalled its whey protein concentrate products suspected of being contaminated with toxin from bacteria that could lead to botulism, a potentially fatal disease, but later said it was a false alarm. China has banned imports of the whey protein used by local milk powder makers since August 2013, the report said.
