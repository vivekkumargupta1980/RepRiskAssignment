The agents are alleging Fred Hanson, who was arrested on Nov. 27 and charged with 14 drug-trafficking counts, worked with the individuals in an effort to conceal the source of his money, the release states.
"Hanson would give cash from the drug proceeds to several of his associates, who would then turn around and write a check to Hanson's painting company to make it appear as if they were paying for work performed," the release states.
Those arrested Friday were:
Justin Bunn, 44, Daytona Beach;
Bradly Graham, 38, Port Orange;
Justin Kirby, 29, Port Orange;
Jay Knouse, 32, Holly Hill;
Norma Payne, 41, Daytona Beach Shores;
Michael Whitten, 39, Port Orange.
Each was charged with one count of money laundering and transported to the Volusia County Branch Jail in Daytona Beach, where Hanson is also being held on $650,000 bail.
The Volusia Bureau of Investigation, a multi-agency task force involving 10 local, state and federal law-enforcement agencies, made the arrests. Agents dubbed the investigation "Operation Bo-Flex," based on Hanson's nickname "Bo."
Payne and Graham face additional drug-related charges.
