SPEAKERS: KENNETH ROTH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH
MATT MILLER, BLOOMBERG NEWS
STEPHANIE RUHLE, BLOOMBERG NEWS
[*] STEPHANIE RUHLE, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Well our next guest is truly an expert on the subject. He traveled to Europe just last week to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel about the deteriorating situation of course in the Ukraine. And here to tell us what the EU and U.S. are planning to do as the Ukraine withdraws its troops from Crimea is human rights executive director, Ken Roth. Ken, welcome.
KENNETH ROTH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH: Thank you.
RUHLE: So last week you met with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
ROTH: Well actually Tuesday, and it was Tuesday morning. It was two days ago.
RUHLE: Two days ago, all right, hot off the presses. What happened? What did she say?
ROTH: Well obviously we were talking mainly about Ukraine and Russia. And German policy toward Russia for years has been very much guided by the business community, which had this theory that if you just trade, if you just engage then Putin will behave more nicely.
MATT MILLER, BLOOMBERG NEWS: And German chancellors typically work there when they're done in Germany.
RUHLE: Hold on a second.
ROTH: Yes, yes, yes, sure, that's happened.
RUHLE: If you just behave, if you just follow the rules Putin will behave more nicely?
ROTH: Basically the more you engage, the more you trade with him he'll be a nicer guy. It didn't work. And so Merkel is in the process of recalibrating. And part of it is rhetorical, part of it is the sanctions. She clearly at this stage is focused not simply on the Crimea but the threat of further incursions into Eastern Ukraine, but when I talked with her about really ways of undercutting Putin's pretext for his actions, because you remember Putin is saying these right-wing forces are attacking Russian language speakers in Eastern and Southern Ukraine. That's mostly fiction. And so the way to undercut it is first of all to deploy international monitors, which Merkel is pushing. Putin is resisting.
RUHLE: How do you do that?
ROTH: The OSCE, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, has 800 monitors ready to go. Putin is not letting them deploy in the areas, particularly in Crimea where they're urgently needed. It's also important to press the Ukrainian government because there are right-wing members of that government who for example the other day attacked a TV journalist for having the audacity of airing Putin's speech on the Crimea. So you need to make sure that the Ukrainian government acts in a rights respecting way to undercut this kind of pretext.
RUHLE: Are you afraid?
ROTH: Well I am very worried. We've seen for example Putin is cracking down in Russia, shutting off TV stations, closing down websites, arresting with hundreds of activists all with the aim of sort of preventing any dissent, preventing anybody to challenge his propagandistic view of what's going on.
RUHLE: Preventing the truth to come out.
ROTH: Precisely.
MILLER: Well he continues to do that, right? He's been doing it for a number of years.
ROTH: Well no. It's gotten much worse. Yes there's been a gradual trend really over the last two years since Putin reassumed the presidency, but it is much worse in the last say month or so.
RUHLE: Then why do you think the people of Crimea want to be part of this, out of fear?
ROTH: Well I think that we're going to find over the long term that the people of Crimea will respond the same way as the people of Southeastern Russia or [Apazia] respond to these sections of Georgia that Russia basically took over.
MILLER: And they're still there. We - I keep reminding people that we're still in - Russia is still in South Georgia and -
ROTH: Not essentially yes, but the people of Southeast [sechia] feel basically forgotten. They were the center of the universe when Russia took over and now they're forgotten. I think that Crimea will probably find something simple, so similar. So I think the best long-term strategy for Ukraine is to create a rights respecting democracy that the people of Crimea want to be part of rather than Putin's authoritarian rule.
RUHLE: Do they have the strength to actually do that though?
ROTH: Well Ukraine has been up and down when it comes to rights. They had their Orange Revolution nearly a decade ago. It then became increasingly authoritarian and corrupt. Hopefully this time around they get it right.
MILLER: But do they have any choice? The people of Crimea from our perspective it looks like a fairly done deal. The EU is looking for a way to back out of a second round of sanctions. Obviously they have a strong business relationship with Russia and they want to keep, they want to keep their fuel. Isn't it over there?
ROTH: Well I think that Crimea is over with for the time being. The real issue is Eastern Ukraine. Putin is threatening to invade there. And you're right that the German business community in particular has never seen a Putin step that they didn't want to respond to with more trade and more business. And Merkel is finally beginning to stand up to the business community. It's not clear how much though. And Germany is really trying to find its way. Does it stand for principle or does it just stand for business? And the answer to that is actually shifting quite radically over the last few months.
RUHLE: From what to what?
ROTH: Well from in the past -
MILLER: Full business.
ROTH: - at least full business to suddenly recognizing that Germany is the leader of the European Union, particularly with respect to Russia. If Germany doesn't act the EU doesn't act. And Merkel sees the need for leadership here.
MILLER: So you're looking for a better balance basically.
ROTH: Precisely.
MILLER: Not a complete turnaround.
ROTH: Well it's never going to be a complete turnaround.
MILLER: Right.
ROTH: But I think if you get past this view that simply trading with Putin is going to change him. It doesn't.
MILLER: All right, Ken Roth.
RUHLE: Probably doesn't. Thank you so, so much for joining us.
ROTH: And thank you.
RUHLE: Quick break for a second, Ken Roth, the executive director of the Human Rights Watch.
