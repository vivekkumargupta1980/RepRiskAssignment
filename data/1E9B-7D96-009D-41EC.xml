Lawmakers within the European Parliament held a meeting on the deal this week, during which EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said the case is not closed. If it is revisited, key aspects of the agreement may unravel, according to the article.
The settlement said Mountain View-based Google must give competitors greater prominence in European search results over the next five years and must display results for at least three rivals each time it shows its own results.&nbsp;Its competitors, consumer groups and politicians are protesting the proposed agreement, saying the solution is worse than the problem it attempts to fix and that it will create another stream of revenue for the world's largest search and advertising company.
The commission is also looking into Google's Android smartphone operating system, after receiving complaints that it too promotes Google's search business.
