Argentine chemical company Atanor has been reported to Argentina's federal justice system by environmentalists and neighbours in San Nicolas for dumping chemical substances at its plant, causing contamination of the Parana river. The case has been handled on a provincial level for seven years. The complainants want Atanor to carry out sanitation tasks in the area, where 300 deaths are said to have occurred in relation to contamination in recent years. Incidents of liquid spills, gas leaks and untreated waste disposal were reported first in 2007 for harming the health of workers and the plant. The company refuted these complaints. Despite a San Nicolas court ordering an investigation into irregular toxic waste dumping, the case is said to have remained on the shelf until pressure from local communities led to an order for conflict mediation. This was criticised for being too mild when damage to public health was at stake. Although authorities have treated the case with little importance, a geological study has revealed strange elements buried at the Atanor plant, consistent with workers' accounts. The prosecution has been accused of dismissing an order by the public rights authority and the Health Ministry for a study on the alleged links between residents' location and damaged health. Atanor has already been involved in other environmental conflicts in Argentina, with a facility in Vicente Lopez closed down by the town, and a complaint over the leak of 18,000 litres of a powerful herbicide in San Jose de la Esquina.
