Following a four-month hidden-camera investigation, the animal rights group Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has accused the dual Eclipse Award-winning trainer and his now ex-assistant Scott Blasi of subjecting horses to "cruel or injurious mistreatment", administering drugs for non-therapeutic reasons and employing one of their jockeys to use a banned electrical device known as a buzzer.
Peta has sent its complaints, accompanied by a nine-minute video, to state and federal agencies in Kentucky and New York.
IFHA chairman Louis Romanet said: "Animal welfare is a core value of the IFHA, whose code of global industry standards states that practices which jeopardise the health and welfare of the horse are prohibited.
"Two key missions of the IFHA are to ensure the quality and fairness of racing in the interest of breeding and the public, and to provide the organisation on racecourses for protecting the welfare of horses, jockeys and the people attending.
"Any matter that is a threat to these fundamental ideals must be promptly handled by the appropriate regulatory authorities."
