A combination of the loss of several vital contracts and restrictions on borrowing forced local coach firm Ber-Line International into liquidation. The family-owned business had expanded rapidly from small beginnings - it started with a family saloon car - and now provided continental holidays in a fleet of 15 luxury coaches. All 10 employees were set to lose their jobs. The economic news was not all gloom as a firm submitted a planning application to set up a car import business in Moreton Valence. This project would offer employment opportunities to people facing redundancy from RAF Quedgeley.
As the miners' strike continued, National Union of Mineworkers' president Arthur Scargill urged members to behave responsibly after the death of a protester on the picket line. Violence erupted as police and pickets clashed outside Ollerton Colliery in Nottinghamshire. Coal board chairman Ian MacGregor regretted the death, describing it as a tragic accident but commented that the flying pickets had not been withdrawn.
