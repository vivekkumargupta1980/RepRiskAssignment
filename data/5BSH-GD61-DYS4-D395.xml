Residents of the village of Maidan, Kadamzhaisky district of the Batken region, said they are against any work on the deposit, including geological exploration or development.
"In any case, it will hurt the environment," Gulbara Nurmatova, a protester, told Interfax.
"Some 5,000 residents of the nearby villages have come to the protest," she said.
The Kyrgyz authorities disregarded the opinion of locals when they issued a license to the Australian company Z-Explorer, she said. "If they had asked us then, we probably could have stated our position and make some demands, including on the observance of environmental standards during the exploration and extraction and could have reached agreements," Nurmatova said.
Among the people who spoke at the rally was Akram Madumarov, the head of the district city administration, who said that Z-Explorer is ready to hear the locals' demands.
A local police inspector told Interfax the protest is going peacefully and without violations. According to him, the protest has some 3,000 participants.
Local residents have protested the work done on the Shambesai deposit for a year now. Last year, when the company began bringing special equipment to the deposit, locals attacked workers and raided the local office of the company. Z-Explorer has not been able to work on the deposit since.
