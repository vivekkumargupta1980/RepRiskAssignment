The Competition Commission of India began investigating the search and advertising company two years ago after receiving complaints from a local wedding website and the Consumer Unity and Trust Society advocacy group.&nbsp;
Besides a stiff fine, the Indian government can also order the Mountain View-based company to break up into separate, smaller companies, according to the report. Google said it is cooperating with Indian authorities.
In February, Google agreed to settle a similar antitrust case over search concerns with the European Union, allowing the company to avoid a $5 billion fine, or 10 percent of its revenue. However, antitrust laws in India do not allow companies to settle, according to The Times of India.
