Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality spokeswoman Jean Kelly confirmed Monday that DEQ was notified of the incident about 6 p.m. Saturday and that the refinery's R.O.S.E. unit (Residuum Oil Supercritical Extraction), had "been under turnaround for a significant amount of time."
Valero spokesman Bill Day acknowledged that there was a flaring of one of Meraux refinery's units "that resulted in visible smoke for about 20 minutes."
Kelly said that as of Monday the DEQ did not believe any reportable quantities of pollutants were released during Saturday's flaring. Residents reported odors after the flaring to the environmental group Louisiana Bucket Birgade's iWitness Pollution Map.
"Typically when you start up and shutdown a unit, there is flaring," Kelly said.
She said that if Valero discovers reportable quantities of emitted pollutants from the event then the company would have to send DEQ a letter within seven days stating what they think was released in the air and how much was released.
In the past year, the Valero plan in Meraux has had several units under turnaround for scheduled maintenance along with a hydrocracker unit revamp project to begin construction of the tie-ins for the new vessel delivered last year.
