A complaint has been filed on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Medicines securities between February 20, 2013 and February 12, 2014, inclusive (the "Class Period") in the District of New Jersey.
The complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws with respect to its disclosures concerning its business, operations, and prospects.
Specifically, the action alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Company's drug candidate, Cangrelor, did not show superiority when compared to clopidogrel, a competing drug previously approved by the FDA; and (ii) the Company's CHAMPION clinical trials comparing Cangrelor's efficacy with that of clopidorel were unethical and improperly administered.
On February 12, 2014, the Company announced that the NASDAQ had halted the trading of its stock in connection with an FDA advisory panel. Later that same day, the FDA advisory panel voted against approval of Cangrelor.
Following this news, the Company's stock declined $3.82 per share, or over 11%, to close at $29.28 per share on February 13, 2014.
