Crash kills 3, injures 2
POLK CITY(AP) - Deputies say Justin and Sharonda Sims and their 5-year-old son Savio died when a tractor trailer struck their 1998 Buick Century at an intersection in central Florida early Tuesday morning.
The Polk County Sheriff's Office says two other children - Ariel, 7, and Kitty, 2 - were critically injured. An infant, 3-month-old Arienne, was properly strapped into her car seat and is in stable condition at a Lakeland hospital. Deputies say the parents and other children were not wearing seat belts.
Deputies say the car, driven by Justin Sims, 31, of Dade City apparently ran through a stop sign as the returned home from shopping at an outlet mall in Orlando. The car was dragged some 400 feet. The boy was in the front seat with his parents.
Ariel and Kitty Sims were airlifted to Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital in Orlando in critical condition.
Investigators say Justin Sims had a suspended driver's license due to failure to pay traffic fines in September.
Antonio Garcia, 31, of Tampa, was driving the truck that hit the family. He was not injured in the crash.
The intersection was shut down for hours as authorities investigated the crash. All roads are now open.
An investigation continues.
PCSO, DBPR crack down â€¨on unlicensed contractors
From Monday, March 3 through Thursday, March 6, the Polk County Sheriff's undercover deputies, working in conjunction with investigators from the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation did an investigation into unlicensed contractual work performed in Polk County. At the end of "Operation Tool Time," detectives arrested 20 people for advertising and proposing contracting work in Polk County without a professional business license.
"When you don't take the time to research the people you hire to do repairs in your home, you open yourselves up to being victimized. Don't trust your home repairs to people who aren't licensed and insured - spend the extra time and money verifying licenses and insurance credentials before letting someone into your home," said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. "Unlicensed contractors can perform shoddy work, resulting in damage, fires, or even injury."
During the operation, detectives answered ads placed online or in periodicals advertising home repairs, and scheduled appointments with those who placed the ads. The types of home repairs the suspects claimed they did ranged from plumbing to electrical. Those who provided written or verbal proposals to perform the work showed up at the location where the "work" was to be done, and were arrested for engaging in contracting business without a license
"Unlicensed activity not only threatens the livelihood of Florida's consumers, but it also takes away jobs from those who are licensed as required by law," said DBPR Secretary Ken Lawson. "Floridians should always verify an individual's professional license with my department prior to having any work performed on their home."
Those arrested were:
Ernie Garcia, 33, of 512 Petteway Drive in Lakeland
