Moreton Bay Regional Council will soon generate enough green energy to power 5,000 homes each year under a new plan to harvest methane gas from landfill waste.
Moreton Bay Regional Council’s Economic Development spokesperson, Cr Brian Battersby, said three large gas engines, with similar capacity to those used in super-sized mining dump trucks, would be installed at council’s Bunya, Dakabin and Caboolture landfill sites to convert methane gas into green energy.
“The landfill gas management systems will cut more than 74,000 tonnes of methane emissions from council’s landfill sites annually and help reduce the region’s carbon footprint,” Cr Battersby said.
“Once captured, the landfill gasses will be filtered, then combusted by the engine generator and converted to renewable electricity, which is fed into the domestic power grid in the same way as household solar panels.”
All landfill sites produce methane and carbon dioxide as a result of the biological breakdown of organic material.
Gas flaring systems, which burn off methane produced naturally by landfill sites, have been operational since 2010 in the Moreton Bay Region.
The landfill power plants are expected to be operational in 2015 with the anticipated savings to council’s energy costs to fund the set up and operation costs of the three generation systems, and help to keep residents’ rates as low as possible.
“Turning waste into a useful energy source is part of council’s long term commitment to delivering sustainable economic and environmental benefits to our community,” Cr Battersby said.
