The Bank is proposing new rules to toughen up the remuneration code that would see employment contracts changed to allow for clawback of bonuses already pocketed.
Regulators have the power to force firms to halt bonus payments that have not yet been cashed in, but once paid they are immune from clawback.
The Bank is carrying out a twomonth consultation on these new clawback plans where there is evidence of employee misbehaviour or significant error, where a firm or business division has suffered a material financial hit, or where there has been failure in risk management.
It also wants to ensure the new rules apply to those indirectly responsible, such as bosses who should be held accountable for the behaviour of their staff, culture and strategy, as well as those who failed to take steps to identify or address misconduct.If given the green light, the new rules would come into effect on January 1 next year - in time for the next round of City and bank bonuses.The move comes in the wake of recommendations from MPs and peers on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and follows the financial crisis and a series of scandals in recent years.
