But one part of the past has been hard to escape and it is visible in all the pictures of bananas on thesite,which are allC avendish.United Fruits' history is so dubious it overshadows its remarkable,if debatable,business achievement.Bananas grow in warm,moist climates,thefruit needsto ripen to near rottenness for all its starches to turn into delicious sugars and at that point it is very hard to transport without damage.But the company calculateditwouldworkif a variety was found with skin thick enough for transport and it was planted on a large enoughscale-hencethatendless needfor land,with low government involvement,which it found in Central America.They foundthisin a variety calledG ros Michel and a banana empire was born.But this is where nature became a problem.Bananas are propagated from root cuttings,not cross bred from seeds,so they end up as clones of each other.This gives the uniform produce that food industries love,but means plants don't have the resistance that comes from genetic variation.Sure enough,a disease emerged that destroyed Gros Michel.This was when Cavendish was found,a variety that miraculously was resistant to the disease and met the other criteria of a commercial banana.Instead of learning the biodiversity lesson,the companies bet their business on this new variety.When scientists,who knew thediseaseswould return,triedtodevelop alternatives,consumers didn't take to them and the companies didn't waste time trying to convince them.Sure enough,Cavendish specific diseases like Black Sigatoka and Tropical Race Four have developed that are now devastating banana plantations across the world.Whilescientists aretrying tocome up with an answer,the only solution is to find new places and this is where Golden Bananas come in.Farmers in areas like Gujarathavehappily jumpedintothe gap,growing Cavendish for the global market,and dumping the excess locally.In the end the diseases will attack Indian Cavendish as well and we will be the poorer for having neglected our marvellous array of local bananas in favour of thissingle,flawed,foreign-promoted variety.But it doesn't have to be that way.The new Chiquita Fyffe's could use its very real organisational and marketing abilities to promote multiple varieties.Refrigerated ships and climate controlled containers mean that India is no longer too far for fruit exports to the West,so this might be the time to start promoting our many types of bananas,not as a singletypeof cheapfruit,butfor all their varied,complex qualities.And once consumers abroad start really to appreciate Indian bananas,perhaps Indian consumers might too!
