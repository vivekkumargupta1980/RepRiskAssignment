As EPA has moved closer to issuing the rule, now due for release April 17, top industry officials, grid operators and supportive lawmakers have warned agency officials that requiring strict closed-loop cooling systems would impose costly mandates on a sector that provides a reliable power supply but is struggling to compete with cheap natural gas.
"The retirement of even a small number of nuclear units would have significant reliability and climate change implications," says a Jan. 24 letter to EPA signed by the top executives of five companies with large nuclear portfolios, Exelon Corp., PG&E Corp., Dominion, Public Service Enterprise Group and NextEra Energy.
The letter adds that since October 2012, companies have announced the retirement of five reactors representing nearly 4,200 megawatts of power. If that pace continues, a quarter of the nation's nuclear fleet could shutter by 2020, causing the country to "lose over half of the progress we have made to date toward meeting President Obama's 2020 emissions reduction goal of 17 percent of 2005 emissions."
In addition to potential regulatory costs from the cooling water rule, the letter highlights continued economic viability threats the sector faces from low natural gas prices.
One of the executives, Exelon CEO Chris Crane, who is also the vice chairman of the Nuclear Energy Institute, met Feb. 20 with EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. A company spokesman says the discussion "focused primarily on nuclear power" but declined to provide further details.
The grid operator for the mid-Atlantic region, PJM Interconnection, also wrote a Jan. 30 letter to EPA urging "that the present economic challenges facing the existing [nuclear] fleet be considered as you develop [Clean Water Act (CWA)] Section 316(b) regulations" because of the sector's role in maintaining a mix of generation sources in the region.
And a group of GOP senators echoed the industry's arguments when they called on federal wildlife regulators last month to "vacate" the ongoing consultation with EPA to ensure the final rule does not adversely affect threatened or endangered species.
The lawmakers argued that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) can only be addressed on a site-specific basis, and not in a national rule, adding that strict requirements could jeopardize facilities "that provide clean and low-cost power to many of our constituents," though Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) Director Dan Ashe appeared to reject the request during recent Senate testimony.
While Ashe rejected the request to abandon the consultation, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy is suggesting the agency will address the industry's concern. "I think they will find that when this final rule is released that we have listened very closely to their comments," she told POWERNews.
Upcoming Rule
EPA in the coming weeks is set to finalize the section 316(b) regulation, which generally sets a flexible, site-specific standard for reducing the entrainment of fish eggs and larvae into cooling systems but sets a strict nationwide standard for reducing the impingement of live adult fish on the structures.
The rule is a top priority for environmentalists, who are seeking to limit mortality of aquatic species that are sucked up into cooling systems for power plants. To do this, they are pressing the agency to require closed-cycle cooling systems that limit water intake, as well as discharges of heated water.
But the energy and industrial sectors are seeking to limit any mandate for closed-cycle cooling systems that they say are costly and provide few environmental benefits. Instead, they are pushing for EPA to allow alternative technologies and continued use of once-through cooling.
The issue is particularly acute for the nuclear and coal sectors, both of which are facing major economic challenges from cheap natural gas. According to recent Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showing cooling system type by fuel source, 50 nuclear plants in 2012 had once-through systems, compared with 44 that used recirculating systems. Roughly the same percentage of coal-fired plants used once-through systems, though only three in 10 gas plants used the technology.
The EIA data also show that the bulk of once-through systems were constructed before 1980, meaning the rule will likely affect older facilities that could be scheduled for upgrades because newer plants with cooling towers would generally meet the rule's fish safety requirements.
Though the sector is highlighting its climate role to convince the administration that changes to the rule are needed to continue progress on its broader climate efforts, such changes would also benefit a host of other plants with a more intense greenhouse gas profile, most notably nearly 400 coal-fired plants with once-through cooling systems. Adding to the industry's cost concerns, some plants are facing safety issues that may require costly upgrades. The St. Lucie nuclear plant in Florida is under fire over reports showing wear on more than 3,700 cooling tubes at the plant, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
The concern is that if one of the tubes bursts, it could release radioactive fluid, though plant owner Florida Power & Light (FPL), a subsidiary of NextEra, said that the plant is safe and that the wear spots are relatively shallow.
Similar cooling tube wear issues sparked the San Onofre nuclear plant in California to permanently close, though FPL argued those issues were far more extensive than the Florida plant. The majority owner of the San Onofre plant in June cited high costs to replace or fix damaged equipment and uncertainty about when federal regulators would allow the plant to operate again as reasons to close the plant.
The decision leaves one nuclear facility in California, the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, which is located on the coast in San Luis Obispo County and must comply with the state Water Resources Control Board's once-through cooling policy by 2024.
The policy seeks to phase out once-through cooling systems that harm aquatic life and discharge hotter water after it is used for cooling, and environmentalists recently urged the board to reject calls to soften the policy over concerns about the high cost of installing cooling towers -- an argument playing out on a national scale through EPA's rule.
The nuclear executives' letter cites the Diablo Canyon plant, noting it "serves about 10 percent of the state's electricity needs with no greenhouse gas emissions." It argues closed-cycle cooling would cost between $9 billion and $12 billion, "providing negligible environmental benefit."
Species Monitoring
To limit potential costs, the industry and its supporters are seeking to soften a series of provisions in EPA's rule,including monitoring requirements to assess potential impacts to endangered species, requirements for repowered, replaced or rebuilt units -- which if deemed "new" units could have to install closed-loop cooling systems -- and provisions that could be interpreted to require controversial willingness to pay surveys that monetize non-use benefits when making site-specific best technology available (BTA) determinations.
Those issues were among a series of requests identified in a December letter to EPA signed by the nuclear executives and others in an effort led by the Edison Electric Institute.
The agency faces an April 17 deadline to finish the rule, with observers saying the agency is working through ESA considerations as part of a formal consultation with FWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service on the rule. With the ESA consultation still ongoing, the industry and supporters have been seeking to kill any additional requirements to address potential species effects, including any monitoring requirements the agency may be considering, which they fear could drive regulators to require closed-cycle cooling or other strict technology controls.
The recent letter from utility executives, for example, focuses largely on potential ESA requirements in the rule, arguing the services should conclude the rule is "not likely to adversely affect" threatened and endangered species. The executives also argue the rule should not require additional consultation for facilities that have already undertaken site-specific ESA evaluations.
If the services do find potential harmful impacts in a pending biological opinion to be released alongside the final rule, the letter underscores earlier utility calls for ESA monitoring and study requirements to be focused on species "directly affected" by an intake.
"We understand that the proposed ESA provisions will require permittees to identify listed species that may be in the waterbodies from which a facility draws water and might be indirectly affected by intake structures, including by potential impacts to their prey," the letter says. "This overly broad approach could be interpreted to require facilities to prove that the facility is not adversely affecting any [threatened and endangered] species present or that may be present."
The executives argue this approach "could lead to the imposition of requirements not specifically included in the ESA," are "beyond the scope of this rulemaking and that set an untenable precedent for future EPA rulemakings." The letter also warns that such provisions "are not supported by court decisions interpreting the requirements of the ESA." Ultimately, the executives fear the ESA requirements could force facility owners to install costly closed-cycle cooling towers even if there is not evidence of adverse impact to listed species. "Cooling towers are particularly problematic for existing nuclear units because of high retrofit costs associated with safety issues at nuclear plants and space constraints."
But that request appears unlikely to be granted. During a Feb. 25 congressional hearing, FWS' Ashe testified under questioning from Sen. David Vitter (R-LA), the Senate environment panel's ranking Republican, that the cooling water rule's permit framework allowing continued use of cooling waters "will have a significant effect on threatened and endangered species."
"The discussion is about minimizing and avoiding those potential impacts, and reasonable and prudent measures that the EPA and state delegated programs can take" to do so, Ashe said.
Vitter replied that the ESA consultation is questionable because all of the rule's alternatives "are benefits compared to the status quo."
Ashe said that since major environmental statutes were passed in the 1970s, "everything the government does makes life better" for threatened and endangered species. "The question is not whether it is one increment better. The question is, can EPA, within its discretion, undertake reasonable and prudent measures to improve the likelihood that species will be recovered," he said. -- Lee Logan (llogan@iwpnews.com)
