Publication Date: 03/14/2014 Document Type: Article/Newsletter Subject Matter: Construction Law, Labor Employment Law, Personal Injury Summary: In 2012, OSHA warned employers to be cautious about safety incentives that encourage workers not to report workplace injuries. As part of this memo from OSHA, employers were told to make sure that employees were free to report workplace injuries and illnesses, and that disciplining an employee for reporting an injury could result in a violation of Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (the Act) - the whistleblower provision of the Act. Recently, many unions and worker advocate groups are discussing the concerns related to "blame the worker" programs. Safety incentive programs that reward workers for no lost time accidents or that use signage indicating the number of workdays that have passed since the last accident have become indicators of these "blame the worker" type of safety programs. But what is an employer to do about employees who violate safety policies and, as a result, suffer a workplace injury? Does this mean that an employer cannot discipline an employee who violates a safety rule and is injured? The answer is a resounding "No!"
