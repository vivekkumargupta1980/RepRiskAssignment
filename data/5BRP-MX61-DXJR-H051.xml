While several agencies are busy passing the buck, the motorists have to take extra care to use this risky stretch.
On Wednesday, a biker plunged straight into the ditch and sustained minor injuries before being rescued by the locals. On Friday night, a cyclist fell into the open pit as he failed to spot the barricade.
The pit lies on one of the three-lane corridor. It was dug up by Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) after a private company damaged the water supply line while laying the cables. The ruptured pipe was attended by MIDC workers but they forgot to fill the ditch.
It has been over a month and MIDC is yet to fill the pit which has taken the form of a pond now. Locals say that if the pit remains unattended, a bigger disaster is waiting to happen in the near future. "This has become a dangerous spot, especially for motorists as only two lanes are being used by them. Agencies should immediately fill this ditch to prevent a major mishap," said Bhimnagar resident Mahadev Shingare.
Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), that built the concrete road, is yet to take action to repair the damaged portion. "MIDC has to repair the damaged road," said a civic official.
MIDC, too, is yet to undertake filling work or take the private company to task over the damaged pipeline. "We will carry out the filling work in consultation with the agency," said MIDC sources, when asked about the uncovered pit.
