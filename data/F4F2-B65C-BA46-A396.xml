Spending taxpayer money may annoy people like R Lucas (March 11) but this should be seen for what it is - paying out when politicians' gambles backfire.
In the long term we do better in investment, hence rates/tax income, when New Zealand is seen to resolutely fix egregious systematic mistakes.
Eagerly saying ''yes'' to every fly-by-nighter is economic suicide.
Consider the string of failings in mine inspections, flood prevention, leaky home standards and what was allowed to be built where.
They are bad enough, but the blame evasion and bureaucratic bolognese in lieu of remedies are strong clues nightmares will happen again with oil spills.
Politicians, professional deny- aholics, have too much power to obfuscate risks and ignore experts.
