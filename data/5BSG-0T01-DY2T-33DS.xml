The families are taking the unprecedented step because Calgarybased Baytex Energy has not yet installed promised pollution controls on heated bitumen tanks in the Reno oilfield, said Brian Labrecque, whose father and brothers left their farms south of Peace River due to ill health they blamed on the emissions.
Also, court is the only avenue left since the Alberta Energy Regulator has made clear it has no jurisdiction to regulate fumes from the heated bitumen tanks, said Labrecque, who testified at public inquiry in January held by the regulator into the Baytex emissions.
The case could set a precedent if the court rules for the families and grants an injunction. So far, only the regulator has shut down company operations to deal with pollution issues or spills.
Baytex spokesman Andrew Loosley said company studies show the air is safe and that landowners are opposing company efforts to install the equipment needed to capture fumes from the tanks. "The landowners asking for the injunction do not live there and have said they have no plan to move back," Loosley said in an e-mail.
