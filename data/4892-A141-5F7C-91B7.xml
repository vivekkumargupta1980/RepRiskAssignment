(AP) - Regulators in North Carolina say they plan to modify permits at two Duke Energy coal ash ponds to stop pollution from seeping into public waterways, but environmental groups say the action doesn't go far enough.
Action by the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources involves Duke's ash pits in the Asheville and Charlotte areas.
DENR Secretary John Skvarla said Friday that regulators want to stop all unauthorized discharges from those leaky coal ash pits, and possibly move the waste.
But Southern Environmental Law Center senior attorney Frank Holleman says DENR is dragging its feet.
Earlier this week, Duke President Lynn Good said the company plans to move ash pits at those sites and one along the Dan River, where a coal ash spill coated the waterway with toxic sludge.
