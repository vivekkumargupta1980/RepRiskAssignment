Ofgem said soaring household bills and intensifying public distrust highlighted the need for an investigation which will determine whether the companies are making excess profits - after they quadrupled to more than £1bn in three years.
But British Gas owner Centrica warned that the probe, expected to last up to two years, could create uncertainty and threaten the billions of pounds worth of investment needed to keep the lights on.
Ofgem said a full-scale probe by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) would "clear the air" amid concerns that switching between suppliers had fallen and that those who never switched, many of them vulnerable customers, were being ripped off.
It also said it had found evidence of "possible tacit co-ordination" between companies on the timing and size of price announcements but stopped short of accusing them of explicitly colluding in an illegal cartel arrangement.
The CMA has extensive powers to shake up the sector by removing "long-term structural barriers to competition" which could include separating firms' generation arms from retail divisions selling gas and electricity to homes and businesses.
Retail profits increased from £233m in 2009 to £1.1bn in 2012, Ofgem said. It also found prices had risen by 24% over the period, well ahead of the rate of inflation at 13.8%.
The energy sector has been under intense political pressure in recent months over rising household bills at a time of a prolonged real-term squeeze on pay.
Labour pledged in September that it would force suppliers to freeze tariffs. The industry broadly rejected the policy as unworkable but on Wednesday SSE pledged to keep prices on hold until January 2016, pressuring rivals to follow suit.
Scrutiny has focused on the socalled Big Six - Centrica, SSE, E.ON, npower, RWE and EDF - which control 95% of the gas and electricity market in the UK.
They also own around 70% of the generating capacity - though only Centrica has significant gas production capability as part of its UK group. It also has nearly 40% of the gas retail market, through British Gas, meaning it looks vulnerable if there is action to break up the dominant players in the sector.
Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw said he welcomed the chance to clear the air but claimed competition in the market was already intense.
But he voiced fears that a lengthy probe could damage confidence at a time when more than £100bn of new investment is needed in new infrastructure.
Paul Massara, chief executive of npower, said he supported a probe to make public "the realities of the energy market."
He said: "We repeat our support for a full competition inquiry to provide solid, lasting evidence about the state of competition in the energy market today so that consumers and companies can be clear about the foundation for energy policy in the future."
The CMA investigation will be the first ever full-scale competition probe into the energy sector and will subject it to an unprecedented degree of scrutiny. It is likely to be launched within weeks following a consultation on Ofgem's findings.
