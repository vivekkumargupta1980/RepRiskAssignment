The 180 MW Bajoli Holi hydropower project, located some 70 km from Chamba, has been facing a public outcry since 2010 as the locals say it could not only displace them but also affect the local ecology.
Twenty-five villagers were arrested last evening on charges of forcibly stopping the project authorities to carry out construction activity, a police official told UNI.
He said they have been booked under various sections including 332 (causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) and 153-A (promoting enmity).
Local activist Mangni Ram said the women were staging a peaceful protest when they were arrested.
'We will not allow the project people to axe trees (from the project site) and carry out any construction activity.'
The activist said the project has secured forest clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests without the consent of the local gram sabhas in violation of the Forest Rights Act of 2006.
'Holi and its nearby villages are going to be hit badly by the project resulting in deforestation, drying up of water channels and even forced displacement,' he added.
The state government awarded the hydropower project to GMR Hydro Power on build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis for 40 years from the date of commissioning.
The company aims to commission the project by January 2018. UNI XC DJK NS1822 NNNN
