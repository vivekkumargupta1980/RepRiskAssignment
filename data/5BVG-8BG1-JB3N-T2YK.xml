CCI is investigating a 2012 complaint that alleged Mountain View, California-based Google was abusing its dominant position in online search and search advertising.
“The order was passed on a reference made by the DG to CCI alleging inter alia non-cooperation by Google in the pending investigations,” CCI said in its order.
Google has failed to comply with the directions given by the director general seeking information and documents, the CCI said in its March 27 order. “We’re disappointed by this development. While we are confident that our products are compliant with competition law in India, we continue to cooperate fully with the CCI’s extensive and ongoing investigation,” Google said in a statement. The company was yet to receive the order, Google said.
Last year, Google reached settlements with competition regulators in the US and Europe in probes that included concerns similar to those in India.
These include alleged preferential treatment in the hierarchical presentation of results of ‘Google’ searches, favouring the company’s own products and services over those of rivals.
Recently, the US Federal Trade Commission has told the Indian competition watchdog that Google is using its superior technology to push out competitors from the GPS tracking market. It also said Google has entered into contracts with small players to create entry barriers for other players.
