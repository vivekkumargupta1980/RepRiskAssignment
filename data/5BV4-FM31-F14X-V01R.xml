The news follows several companies being subject to unannounced inspections by European Commission (EC) authorities yesterday (25 March).
The Commission has concerns the companies concerned may have violated EU antitrust rules prohibiting cartels and restrictive business practices and/or abuse of a dominant market position
Representatives of the EC were at Tenneco's Edenkoben, Germany, administrative facility to gather information in connection with the investigation, while the company has also received a related subpoena from the US Department of Justice.
A statement from Tenneco said: "The company is fully cooperating with the authorities and cannot comment further due to the ongoing investigation.&nbsp; Tenneco's values and Code of Conduct are foundational elements for how the company conducts business.&nbsp;
"All Tenneco employees are expected to exemplify these values and strictly adhere to the Code of Conduct, which requires operating in an ethical manner and according to all laws and regulations including practicing fair and open competition."
Earlier today, Eberspacher confirmed it had been the subject of an unanounnced EC inspection.&nbsp;
