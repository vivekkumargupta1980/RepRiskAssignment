Olmert and other defendants were accused of smoothing over legal and zoning restrictions for a construction project in south-west Jerusalem, known as Holyland, in return for money. The verdict likely spells the end of Olmert's political career. In Israel, the maximum sentence for accepting bribes by a public figure is 10 years. Experts say he could face several years in jail.
Sentencing arguments are scheduled to begin on April 28. The verdict makes Olmert the first former Israeli premier to have been found guilty of taking bribes. 'Olmert lied in court,' Tel Aviv District Court judge David Rozen said as he delivered the verdict. The former premier's attorney, Roy Blecher, said his team would study the 700-page verdict before deciding on an appeal, but told reporters: 'The last word hasn't been said.' 'It's not an easy day for us. It's not an easy day for Mr. Olmert,' he said. 'We will study our steps.' The judge based his decision on evidence provided by a state witness, according to whom Olmert had asked him to transfer 500,000 Israeli shekels (approximately 140,000 dollars) to his brother, Yossi Olmert. The state witness, businessman Shmuel Dechner, died last year aged 75. The judge reacted angrily to Olmert's attempts to 'besmirch' the witness, but Olmert's media advisor, Amir Dan, charged after the verdict that the court itself had called Dechner too a 'liar' and that as a result of his death, the defence had no opportunity to cross-question him. Corruption allegations had forced Olmert to resign as prime minister and call early elections in 2009. Those brought Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the nationalist Likud party back to power. A centrist, Olmert had been in the midst of far-reaching negotiations with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas when he was forced to step down. Both later said they had been close to a breakthrough. In July 2012, a Jerusalem court largely acquitted Olmert in another corruption trial in which he was accused of accepting cash donations in envelopes without reporting them, and of submitting the same travel expenses to different institutions. He was found guilty of a lesser offense - breach of trust - and handed a one-year suspended sentence. His former office manager, Shula Zaken, had initially backed him, but last week reached a plea bargain with the prosecution. The deal involved her agreeing to serve 11 months in jail and paying a fine. The state wanted her as an additional state witness in the Holyland trial. In return it would drop its appeal to Israel's Supreme Court against her acquittals on major charges in the previous Jerusalem corruption trial. In that trial, she had been convicted on two minor counts. Judge Rozen, however, said he was not certain he would accept the bargain. She and Olmert were found guilty along with eight others defendants in the Holyland affair. Last week, Zaken produced recordings that the prosecution argued raise a 'serious suspicion' that Olmert had attempted to obstruct justice and tamper with witnesses during the trials. The recordings could lead to further investigations. 'It's a sad day for my country,' President Shimon Peres said in Vienna, during a state visit to Austria. Opposition leader Yitzhak Herzog said the verdict was a 'badge of honour' for Israel's courts and struggle against corruption.' 'The Holyland Towers stand as a reminder to all those who are greedy, corrupt and hurting the duty to stay pure while serving in public office,' he wrote on his Facebook page. Copyright dpa
