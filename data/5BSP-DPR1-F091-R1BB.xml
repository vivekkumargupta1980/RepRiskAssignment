The NGO's executive director, David Lewis, said Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's report on her probe of the matter had "severe" implications.
"The massive increase in the costs of upgrades from R27 million to in excess of R200m, coupled with the president's failure to take steps to prevent or query escalating costs, reveal that he placed personal and family interests above those of the public."
Corruption Watch agreed with Madonsela that Zuma should repay money used for upgrades not related to security.
"Public officials who authorised the massive spend and flouted procurement laws should be prosecuted, named and removed from office," Lewis said.
The NGO criticised Zuma for failing to co-operate during the investigation.
Lewis said the lack of regard for the public protector had opened the door for illegitimate attacks and intimidation by supporters of the president. - Sapa
