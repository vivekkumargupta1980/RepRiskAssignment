PORT OF MANILA Enrique Razon's International Container Terminal Services owns 28 ports worldwide, 8 of them in the Philippines, including the nation's biggest in Manila. Razon made waves last year when he fired Global Gaming Asset Management of Las Vegas, manager of his new Manila casino (located just a poker chip's throw from the port), for allegedly not doing its job. The dispute is under arbitration in Singapore.
RESCUE WORKERS November's typhoon, which killed 6,000 people, was classified as the deadliest natural disaster in the world for 2013. Henry Sy responded by putting $2.2 million into a calamity fund set up by his SM Group. Tobacco and beer tycoon Lucio Tan contributed a similar amount and deployed his personal airplanes to deliver medicines and other supplies to victims.

Lower Silesia This province in southwest Poland is home to a growing finance and high-tech industry -- the eye-popping Wroclaw Technology Park opened in 2007 in the provincial capital. Financier Leszek Czarnecki's Sky Tower, Poland's tallest building, was inaugurated in 2012.
NEW BLOOD Over half of Jan Kulczyk's investments lie in South African beermaker SABMiller (which bought his stake in Polish brewer Kompania Piwowarska in 2009). SABMiller's stock price is down 15% over the past year. He is looking to new ventures and the next generation to lift returns; son Sebastian runs the family investment firm, which has a stake in an importer of Audi and Volkswagen vehicles. Daughter Dominika joined its supervisory board last July. Kulczyk is also active in real estate investments.
