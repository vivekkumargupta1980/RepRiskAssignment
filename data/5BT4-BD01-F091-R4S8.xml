The couple, who have been dogged by controversy for several years, handed out keys for three-bedroom homes in an estate named after their Zikhulise Company - known locally by the nickname of Shauwnville.
Each also has a lounge, dining area, kitchen, two bathrooms - one en suite - and is fitted with air-conditioning, electrical appliances, furniture and a plasma TV.
"Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I would be a proud owner of such a stunning house," said Malindi Mbeko.
The event was attended by eThekwini Mayor James Nxumalo and the city's head of human settlement Nigel Gumede.
The couple, who are mourning the death of Sbu's brother, said they were happy to put smiles on their staff's faces.
"We're thanking our staff for the dedication and loyalty they have shown us over the years... including the very trying times," said Shauwn referring to run-ins with the law.
The La Lucia couple, who were last month acquitted of more than 100 counts of tax fraud, said life was back to normal.
Mpisane had been accused of inflating the invoices of her business - Zikhulise Cleaning, Maintenance, and Transport CC - by almost R5 million to cut her tax bill.
She was also accused of violating the Close Corporations Act by remaining Zikhulise's sole member when she had a previous fraud conviction.
The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) last month confirmed that the charges of corruption and defeating the ends of justice would also be withdrawn against Mpisane as they related to the tax fraud matter.
