The court of chief judicial magistrate, V K Yawalkar, on Thursday reserved its order by a day after hearing all arguments. Krishna Ratnaparkhi, special consul for the commissioner of central excise and service tax, opposed the bail on grounds that the investigation is in progress to ascertain the exact amount of service tax evaded.
Ratnaparkhi cited a Bombay High Court judgment to show that Sardana was arrested for committing a non-bailable offence.
The company's lawyer, Pratap Pardeshi, pleaded for release of Sardana on bail arguing that his client will deposit the tax amount as soon as possible.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, A T Nimbalkar, superintendent of central excise and service tax, had said, "Investigations carried out by the department revealed that the company started its activities of providing taxable service to various clients on September 2012 and also collected service tax from its customers. The company, however, failed to deposit the collected money in the government account."
The company collected Rs 30.76 crore from its customers out of total liability of Rs 35.31 crore but, instead of depositing the money with the government, used it for business purposes, the statement had said.
