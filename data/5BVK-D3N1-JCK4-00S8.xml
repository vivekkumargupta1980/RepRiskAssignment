The organization has been robocalling residents there to increase resistance to a tax hike.
Some Chesterfieldians aren't happy about that. They don't like the idea of a national outfit sticking its nose into local affairs.
That's an understandable sentiment.
But it's not one you're likely to hear from the ACLU, which spoke up about a textbook controversy in Chesterfield in 2011.
It's not likely to get much of an endorsement from the Sierra Club, which has criticized Dominion Virginia Power for (among many other things) putting more money into its coal-fired Chesterfield power station rather than renewable energy.
Nor will it win many friends at NARAL Pro-Choice America, whose Virginia affiliate has been critical of crisis pregnancy centers in Chesterfield.
But maybe they're all wrong. If so - if Chesterfield ought to be free from outside influence - then the first order of business should be dismissing tough new stormwater regulations handed down by the EPA. The federal agency imposes its will on the county not just through phone calls but also through the threat of fines and even jail time.
