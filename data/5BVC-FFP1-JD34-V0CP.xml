admitted it was ''not appropriate''
that it kept mine subsidence
damage and a major
grout spill in Sugarloaf State
Conservation Area secret
from the public.
A report ito the environmental
damage at the ecologically
sensitive reserve was
issued yesterday afternoon,
more than six months after
Premier Barry O'Farrell
ordered an inter-agency
investigation ito the scandal.
Mining giant Glencore
Xstrata has been ordered to
spend $100,000, or equivalent
in works, on the conservation
area and Orica Australia is
facing prosecution in the
Land and Environment Court
over the grout spill.
While green groups, residents
and Lake Macquarie MP
Greg Piper welcomed the
public release of the report,
they said there were many
questions still to be answered.
Brunkerville resident
Robert Bignell described the
way the scandal was handled
as ''dishonest and a breach of
community trust''.
He said $100,000 was ''peanuts''
for Glencore Xstrata
andwould do nothing to deter
further damage to the conservation
area.
''The government and the
miner hid the destruction of
this beautiful conservation
area from the public,'' he said.
''Then it all ends with a slap
on the wrist and promises it
probably won't happen again.
It's just not good enough and
my concern is that we need to
ensure this beautiful park is
protected.''
Mr Piper said it should not
have been up to the Newcastle
Herald to inform the community
about the damage.
He said the government
investigation failed to address
why the Planning Department
approved longwall mining
under parts of the conservation
area against expert
advice from the Division of
Energy and Resources.
''The report outlines a
series of actions against the
companies involved, some of
which are already under way,
but touches only briefly on
the role of government agencies,''
he said.
''It finds that government
agencies should have
informed the public earlier
but makes no ongoing recommendations
in this regard . . .
''There are still questions
the community wants answered
and I will continue to
pursue these matters.''
A Herald investigation
revealed in August extensive
damage to the reserve caused
by ''greater than predicted''
subsidence from longwallmining
at West Wallsend Colliery.
Cliffs crumbled and collapsed,
a huge chasm opened
up and kilometres of large
cracks stretch across the
reserve. Three large sections
of land subsided on October 2,
2012, the largest creating a
chasm 120-metres long and
17-metres wide.
On June 4, last year,
150 square metres of grout,
being used to repair subsidence
cracks, was accidentally
poured 280 metres down a
creek. According to the
report, the grout spilled from
a ''previously-known potential
exit point'' for more than two
working days.
It is described as a ''substantial
and significant incident''.
Minister for Planning and
Infrastructure Brad Hazzard
said the Office of Environment
and Heritage and the Environment
Protection Authority
began court proceedings
against Orica last week.
The company is facing allegations
it damaged the conservation
area and polluted
waters, each charge carries a
maximum penalty of $1 million.
''Given all of us were
shocked at the photos of the
grouting debacle, it is heartening
to see in more recent
photos that the remediation is
well under way and that the
creek area is being restored,''
Mr Hazzard said.
It is understood that the
clean-up operation, that is
close to being finished, has
cost more than of $600,000.
The report said the mine
subsidence damage was found
to have ''exceeded the predictions''
and was a risk to public
safety.
According to the report,
because the subsidence was
''not predicted'' it was ''not
avoidable''.
The state's peak environmental
group, the Nature
Conservation Council of
NSW, said the incident
raised serious concerns
about links between the government
and major resource
companies.
Campaigns director Kate
Smolski said this ''sorry incident''
highlighted the ''unacceptable
risks'' longwall mining
posed to sensitive
environmental issues.
''The company and the government
attempted for
months after the subsidence
originally occurred in October
2012 to keep this shameful
event hidden from the public,''
she said.
''It was only when the
remediation work went horribly
wrong in June 2013 and
the Newcastle Herald exposed
the debacle that the public
became aware of what had
occurred.
''Incidents like these give
the impression that the EPA
and the government are putting
the concerns of the
powerful mining industry
ahead of the environment and
the public interest.''
