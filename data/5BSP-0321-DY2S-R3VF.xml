Company representatives entered the pleas Wednesday before a state court judge in Cheboygan, Mich. Encana is Canada's biggest natural gas producer. Chesapeake is the No. 2 gas producer in the U.S. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said March 5 that the companies violated state antitrust laws by agreeing in which counties each would bid before a May 2010 auction for exploration rights. Each company faces a charge of conspiring to restrain trade, punishable by a fine of as much as $1 million, and an attempted conspiracy count that carries a $1,000 penalty.
Chesapeake, which spent $400 million on exploration of Michigan's Collingwood shale formation, has since withdrawn from the state. Calgary-based Encana has invested $230 million in Michigan in the past five years, a company spokesman, said.
Schuette said the alleged agreement may have been a key factor in the decline of lease prices from $1,510 an acre at the May 2010 sale to less than $40 an acre five months later.
