Animal rights activists were out in force from 8.30am as repair work on berths at the Port of Dover meant the trade returned to Thanet after a ten-month break.
Around 40 protesters attended the demonstration, holding placards and chanting: "shame on you" as two lorries carrying sheep bound for the continent arrived at the port. Vets were allowed onto one of the lorries to inspect animals and were satisfied with conditions on board.
Green Party councillor Ian Driver, who attended the protest, said: "I am down here to show my anger that the trade has resumed from Ramsgate.
"I'm going to be at every single sailing to let my feelings be known. I want to stand up and be counted against this appalling trade even though the High Court has ruled that the council can't stop it. I think that it's absolutely right for people to protest and stand up for what they believe is morally right and eventually we will stop this trade."
The return of the trade follows a two-week trial at Dover Magistrates Court last month where export company Channel Livestock Ltd and owner Thomas Lomas were fined £9,000 and forced to pay costs of £10,000 for breaches of animal welfare law.
Lomas was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years for breaches of animal welfare rules.
The convictions resulted from a prosecution by Kent County Council Trading Standards after the death of 47 sheep at Ramsgate in September 2012.
Demonstrators claimed they saw the broken leg of a sheep hanging from one of the lorries, although RSPCA officials insisted that vets would have noticed this during their inspections.
RSPCA chief inspector Patrick Hamby said: "There were two lorries that came in. They were supervised loads and one of them was thoroughly inspected.
"In [the exporters'] defence, there was a vet actually doing the inspections - they went through every tier. They did their job and they didn't find any problems.
"They didn't check the other lorry because it was a supervised load, it's proportionate and that's their decision."
It is believed that live animal exporters could use the Port of Ramsgate for up to 15 months while repair work is carried out in Dover.
More than £400,000 was spent policing animal export protests in the space of 18 months when the trade last operated from Ramsgate.
