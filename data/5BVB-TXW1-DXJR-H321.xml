Recently Medianama,a website that reports on web content and e-commerce business in India,revealed that CCI was gathering views of Indian web companies on Google's advertisement and business practices in the country.CCI has reportedly sent a questionnaire to various web entities,seeking their views on whether Google was unfairly promoting its own services or abusing its dominant position in the search and advertisement business to the detriment of other websites and portals in the country.
