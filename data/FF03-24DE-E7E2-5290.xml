Landrieu, U.S Government has issued the following news release:
U.S. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., today expressed relief that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it was dropping its ban on British Petroleum (BP) from entering new government contracts. EPA announced its debarment order in 2012, following BP’s guilty plea to criminal charges in the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
“EPA never should have made this decision in the first place,” said Sen. Landrieu. “BP has rightly been held responsible in a court of law and should continue to make whole the individuals and businesses that were impacted by the oil spill, but barring them from entering new contracts on top of that amounted to double jeopardy and set a terrible precedent that I hope will not be repeated. The good news is that BP will now be able to participate in next week’s lease sale that will bring much-needed revenue to Louisiana and other oil-producing states along the Gulf Coast, as well as boost business for the region’s small and independent service and supply companies.”
The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is holding a lease sale to auction off oil and gas tracts in the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico on Mar. 19 in New Orleans. Much of the money raised form that sale will be subject to a revenue-sharing agreement under Sen. Landrieu’s Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA).
