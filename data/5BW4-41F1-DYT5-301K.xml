U.S. representatives of the Tatra lorry maker came unexpectedly to the meeting at a shooting range in Centerville, USA, with the aim to lobby, Topolanek (Civic Democrats, ODS) said, adding that their behaviour was unusual.
According to the charges, Bartak in his capacity as then first deputy defence minister attempted to influence the contract on the supply of several hundred Tatra off-road vehicles.
The charges also say Bartak, a member of the PM's delegation, demanded a five-million-dollar bribe from Tatra's supervisory board head William Cabaniss, former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic, to settle the firm's dispute with Prague that threatened Tatra's lucrative order, during his business trip to the United States in 2008.
"I completely rule out that Martin (Bartak) made a corruption offer during this conversation," Topolanek told the Prague Municipal Court today.
He added that the Tatra representatives were trying to lobby and they addressed him at a shooting range as they feared to lose the contract over a dispute with Praga, a subcontractor of axles.
The axles were breaking and this is why Tatra terminated its contract with Praga and the firms found themselves in a lawsuit.
Topolanek said the then government had taken no steps to withdraw from the contract.
In spite of it, Tatra should have agreed with and compensated the Czech firm for the loss it suffered, Topolanek added.
Former ODS MP Jan Vidim, who was a member of the lower house defence and security committee when the case surfaced, told the court later today that he considered it unfair of Tatra to terminate its contract with Praga.
Participation of a Czech subcontractor was one of the main reasons why the government placed the order directly with Tatra without putting up a tender, Vidim emphasised.
Cabaniss and then Tatra manger Duncan Sellars gave their testimonies in court previously. They both said Bartak had asked for a bribe in the United States.
Topolanek said his cabinet had to deal with the Tatra contract left over by the previous government, similar to the lease of the Gripen fighters, the purchase of the Pandur armoured personnel carriers (APC) and an extension of the Temelin nuclear power plant.
Americans were exerting a strong pressure on some of these orders, said Topolanek, whose testimony lasted for over an hour.
The intelligence services have classified the U.S. Tatra managers' behaviour as corrupt, he pointed out.
Bartak said Topolanek told the truth.
The court was also to hear former defence minister Vlasta Parkanova, whose deputy Bartak was, but she excused herself from the proceedings for health reasons.
Another defendant in the case is lobbyist Michal Smrz, owner of the MPI Group arms firm.
He is charged with an attempt to extract money from Tatra representatives by pretending influence on and contacts with high-ranking government and Defence Ministry officials.
In January 2008, Smrz allegedly promised then Tatra director general Ronald Adams to arrange a personal meeting with the prime minister (Topolanek) for money.
Both Bartak and Smrz plead innocent. They call the charges absolute nonsense and an expediently fabricated construct.
