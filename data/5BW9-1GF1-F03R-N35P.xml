Apr 01, 2014 (DealBreaker:http://www.dealbreaker.com Delivered by Newstex) http://dealbreaker.com/?attachment_id=123450Société Générale was, like Goldman Sachs[1], allegedly much better at coming up bribes[2] than it was as managing the Libyan sovereign wealth fund's wealth.
Libya's sovereign wealth fund has filed a $1.5 billion (£901.87 million) lawsuit against Societe Generale, accusing it of funnelling bribes worth tens of millions of dollars to associates of Saif al-Islam, the son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. 'Societe Generale contests the unfounded allegations in the Libyan Investment Authority's (LIA) complaint,' a spokeswoman for France's second-biggest bank said in an emailed statement, without giving more details…. The LIA alleges that SocGen paid at least $58 million to Leinada, a Panamanian-registered company, for advisory services related to $2.1 billion of derivative trades that the Libyan sovereign wealth fund entered into with SocGen between late 2007 and 2009. The LIA's legal filing claims that Leinada did not have the expertise to advise or structure such deals.
