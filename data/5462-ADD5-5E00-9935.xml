It recalls the High Commissioner Navi Pillays conclusion that national mechanisms have consistently failed to establish the truth and achieve justice, and her recommendation that the Human Rights Council establish an international inquiry mechanism to further investigate the alleged violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law and monitor any domestic accountability processes.
The resolution calls upon the Government of Sri Lanka to conduct an independent and credible investigation into allegations of violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as applicable; to hold accountable those responsible for such violations; to end continuing incidents of human rights violations and abuses in Sri Lanka; and to implement the recommendations made in the reports of the Office of the High Commissioner.
The resolution has also been amended to exclude a series of contentious words such as replacing the words rapid rise in violence and discrimination on the basis of religion or belief with significant surge in attacks against members of religious minority groups in Sri Lanka, including Hindus, Muslims and Christians.
It, however, urges the Government to investigate all alleged attacks, by individuals and groups, on journalists, human rights defenders, members of religious minority groups, and other members of civil society, as well as on temples, mosques and churches, and further urges the Government of Sri Lanka to hold perpetrators to account and take steps to prevent such attacks in the future.
The draft is to be discussed at another informal discussion to be held in Geneva on Tuesday (18) convened by the co-sponsors of the resolution.
