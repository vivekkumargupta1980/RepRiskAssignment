The four steel cylinders carrying granular uranium hexafluoride fell Thursday at around 10 p.m., setting off a short-lived radiation scare at the Ceres terminal in the city's north end.
Firefighters determined there wasn't a leak of radioactive material when the cylinders encased in concrete, each weighing about 4.5 tonnes, fell from a pallet as they were being lifted off the ship and landed in a contained area of the vessel.
Phil McNulty, the city's executive fire officer, said one of the lift's arms failed and sent the cylinders tumbling onto other containers on the ship. There were no injuries and no one was contaminated at the terminal in Fairview Cove.
The granular substance was contained in the cylinders, McNulty added.
"They go to great lengths to ensure the safety of the product because human beings are dealing with it all the way from start to the end user," he said.
District commander Peter Andrews said an evacuation area at the port extended about 150 metres and would remain in place until after a consultant hired by RSB Logistic, the Canadian company responsible for shipping the product, completed examining the area to confirm no containers were compromised.
Andrews said that work was expected to conclude Saturday morning, at which point normal operations at the port would resume and the cylinders would be placed on a truck and continue to their destination in Columbia, S.C.
