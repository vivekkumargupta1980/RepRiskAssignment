Duke Energy to begin cleanup in Danville
DANVILLE, Va. - A North Carolina power company will begin cleaning up a large coal ash deposit from the Dan River in Danville next week.
A park along the Dan will be closed Tuesday so Duke Energy can begin removing the toxic sludge from a massive spill upriver in North Carolina.
Danville officials say Duke expects the work to end in July.
The (Danville) Register & Bee reported that Duke crews and contractors will use the park as a staging area. The park includes a boat access ramp and a boathouse. The city will be compensated for revenue losses related to the closing.
Duke officials said the deposit spans 350 yards by 20 yards and is about a foot deep.
City, federal and state officials have said treated city water exceeds safedrinking standards.
Police: Man killed in shootout first shot wife
LINCOLNTON - Lincolnton police say the man they killed during a shootout admitted during a two-hour standoff that he fatally shot his estranged wife hours earlier.
Police say 40-year-old Anthony Ray Osburn of Lincolnton was killed in a blaze of gunfire early Friday. Authorities say he admitted to shooting 39-year-old Tara Lynn Osburn during negotiations for his surrender.
After a delivery driver discovered the woman's body outside a home east of Lincolnton on Thursday, an officer who stopped Osburn's pickup in the apartment complex where he lived reported being fired on.
A SWAT team eventually fired tear gas into his apartment. Authorities say Osburn walked out and again traded gunshots with officers. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The SBI is investigating according to policy in officer-involved shootings.
Forest officials offer advice on ramp collection
ASHEVILLE - With warmer weather approaching, visitors to the Pisgah and Nantahala national forests will turn out to collect ramps.
But officials with U.S. Forest Service are asking people to avoid collecting too much.
Gary Kauffman, botanist with the National Forests in North Carolina, said there's been a decline in populations of ginseng and other forest products such as ramps. Kauffman said if their numbers get too low, the Forest Service may have to shorten the harvest season or ban the harvest altogether.
