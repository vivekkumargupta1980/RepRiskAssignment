A Wesleyan University student who says she was raped during a drunken 'strip show party' at a fraternity house has filed a federal lawsuit against the organization, the alleged assailant and 11 other frat members that were at the party.
The lawsuit says the student, a freshman, was raped in the common room of the Psi Upsilon fraternity house at 242 High Street while surrounded by other students during a wild house party last May, NBC Connecticut reported.
According to the lawsuit, the female student went to Middlesex Hospital after the party.
She was evaluated with a rape kit that confirmed she had been sexually assaulted.

The victim claims when she got to the party she realized it was 'pledge strip show' and that a number people were removing their clothes.
When she went to leave, she was picked up from behind by a guy who put her on a tabletop and started grinding up against her.
She was then raped over the arm of a couch, with numerous people in the common room at the time.
The alleged assailant was later expelled.
The victim has taken a leave of absence and is seeking to $1 million in damages for medical and psychological treatment.
The suit holds both the national fraternity and local organization accountable, but does not name Wesleyan University.
It is the second time the fraternity has come under fire with rape allegations.
'I can't even describe the pain of being raped, or how much it alters a life, and no other person should ever be forced to have that experience,' the victim stated in the lawsuit.
'I hope my experience and lawsuit will create changes that protect others.'
The basis of the suit is negligence.
'Despite demanding self-governance, the Fraternity Defendants fail to adequately and reasonably train themselves and abide by such responsibilities, particularly with respect to safety/risk management issues involving fraternity events, events inside the fraternity house, security, sexual abuse prevention, hazing, and the use and misuse of alcohol,' it reads.
Psi Upsilon Fraternity Executive Director Tom Fox said the national organization was notified of the lawsuit on Wednesday.
'Psi Upsilon Fraternity takes all reports of risk management violations, especially those with regard to sexual assault, very seriously,' Fox said in a statement.
'We are currently investigating the incident and gathering further information.'
Fox added that all members of the organization are required to complete an online program encompassing alcohol, hazing and sexual assault education.
Wesleyan University President Michael S. Roth provided The Hartford Courant with a written statement that says there have been sanctions against the university.
'On behalf of the university community, I want to express our horror at this shameful assault,' said Roth said in the statement.
'Sexual violence on college campuses is a national problem, and it's important to raise awareness about this issue.'
The female student has taken a leave of absence from the university.
