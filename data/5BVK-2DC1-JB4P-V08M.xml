To Contact The Firm</title><source>PR Newswire</source><author></author><text><![CDATA[ Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, reminds investors in AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. ("AmTrust" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: AFSI) of the April 7, 2014 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action lawsuit filed against AmTrust and certain executives.

A complaint has been filed on behalf of all persons who purchased AmTrust securities between February 15, 2011 and December 11, 2013, inclusive (the "Class Period") in the Southern District of New York.
The complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws with respect to its disclosures concerning its business, operations, and prospects.
Specifically, the action alleges that throughout the Class Period Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that the Company: i) manipulated its loan loss reserves and its deferred tax liabilities; ii) underestimated its life settlement contracts' discount rates in an attempt to inflate its reported assets and total stockholder's equity; and iii) failed to implement adequate internal and financial controls.
On December 12, 2013, analyst firm Geoinvesting issued a report exposing the foregoing accounting improprieties at AmTrust.  Upon this news, the Company's stock declined $4.63 per share, or over 12%, to close at $33.67 per share on December 12, 2013.
