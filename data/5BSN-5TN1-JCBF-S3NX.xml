United States Attorney A. Lee Bentley, III announces that David Allen Dinsbeer (37) today pleaded guilty to 16 counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. Each count carries a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison. Dinsbeer is currently released on bond, pending a sentencing hearing.
Dinsbeer was indicted on October 3, 2013.
According to court records, between January 2011 and May 2012, Dinsbeer defrauded the Hickory Foods group of companies out of approximately $904,000. The Hickory Foods companies are best known for Bubba Burgers. The investigation revealed that Dinsbeer used phony supplier companies to bill for supplies that were never delivered. He then deposited checks, which were issued on false invoices, into bank accounts for the phony companies, which he controlled. An FBI forensic accountant determined that the companies had no legitimate business expenses and that Dinsbeer withdrew money from the accounts, using them to pay his personal expenses. To facilitate the scheme, Dinsbeer conspired with an employee of Hickory Foods companies.
This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Dale Campion.
