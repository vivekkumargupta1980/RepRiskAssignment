The FCA found that Besso operated a weak control environment for sharing commissions with third parties which gave rise to an unacceptable risk that they could be used for corrupt purposes.
Tracey McDermott, FCA enforcement and financial crime director, said: "Despite receiving two visits from us, and numerous industry wide warnings, Besso failed to ensure that they had proper systems and controls in place to counter the risks of bribery and corruption in their business activities."
"Firms must play their part in preserving the integrity of the UK financial system, including taking all steps necessary to prevent financial crime. Where we find firms failing to do so, we will take action," McDermott said.
Besso's rule breaches occurred between 14 January 2005 and 31 August 2011.
Among the broker's breaches were: failing to conduct an adequate risk assessment of third parties before entering into business relationships, failing to maintain adequate records of the anti-bribery and corruption measures taken on its third party account files, and having limited bribery and corruption policies and procedures in place between January 2005 and October 2009.
Besso has confirmed the settlement reached with the FCA.
In a statement the broker said: "The FCA has not said that Besso permitted any illicit payment or inducement to any such third party. Further the FCA recognised that Besso made significant efforts to improve its systems and controls framework. The FCA acknowledged that Besso is a medium sized broker in the wholesale insurance market whose business does not, overall, pose a high bribery and corruption risk."
