The Justice Department and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that Flint Hills Resources in Port Arthur will adopt new technologies to control pollutants that result from industrial flares and leaking equipment.
The company also will pay a $350,000 penalty for violating the Clean Air Act.
Officials say the settlement will reduce emissions of hazardous pollutants like benzene by about 1,880 tons each year. They say the plant near the border with Louisiana also will cut greenhouse gases by some 69,000 tons.
The plant manufactures chemicals that are used in a variety of products, including medical devices and automotive parts.
