The embattled CBN governor, who denied the allegation of financing terrorism levelled against him by the Goodluck Jonathan administration, insisted that the government had failed to substantiate the allegation.
Sanusi made these submissions through his counsel, Kola Awodein (SAN), yesterday at the resumed hearing of his fundamental human rights enforcement suit he instituted at the Federal High Court in Lagos.
Meanwhile, the trial judge, Justice Ibrahim Buba has fixed April 3, 2014 to deliver ruling in the suit.
Justice Ibrahim Buba reserved ruling in the matter after lawyers representing parties argued and adopted their briefs in support and against the suit.
Sanusi had filed the suit against the attorney-general of the federation (AGF), Bello Adoke, inspector-general of police, Mohammed Abubakar and the Department of State Security (DSS), seeking perpetual injunction restraining the security agencies from arresting him without following due process.
He had anchored the suit on his arrest and detention for about one hour at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja by DSS operatives upon arrival from Niger Republic shortly after his suspension was announced.
Moving his preliminary objection to the suit, the counsel to the AGF, Fabian Ajogwu (SAN) maintained that the court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the suit considering Section 254 (C) (1) (D) of the 1999 Constitution, which empowers only the National Industrial Court (NIC) to adjudicate on the subject matter.
According to Ajogwu, the cause of action of the suit arose out of labour dispute between Sanusi, the employee and federal government, the employer.
The lawyer also submitted that Sanusi's claim was not constitutionally grantable as law enforcement agencies cannot be perpetually restrained from carrying out their duties.
He added that there was an investigation that was being carried out on Sanusi by law enforcement agencies, apart from the numerous queries already issued him by the federal government.
