Malcolm Fyfield, 58, was the sole survivor of the Gleision mining disaster near Pontardawe, in the Swansea Valley, in 2011.
He managed to crawl out of a flooded mine shaft after a sudden deluge of water killed Charles Breslin, 62; Philip Hill, 44; Garry Jenkins, 39; and David Powell, 50.
Father-of-two Fyfield denies four counts of manslaughter, while MNS Mining Ltd, which operated the pit at the time, has pleaded not guilty to four charges of corporate manslaughter.
Fyfield and two representatives of MNS appeared at Swansea Crown Court yesterday.
Judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams said the trial is set to last at least four months and more than 90 witnesses are expected to give evidence to the court.
The process of selecting 12 potential jurors and four reserves from an initial pool of 70 took more than two hours.
Mr Justice Williams said: "When a jury summons is issued it is expected that you come here to court and be involved in comparatively short cases and that jury service would take two to three weeks. The case that is going to be heard in this case is not going to take two to three weeks.
"It will probably take until the end of June and possibly beyond that."
Proceedings in Court One saw all 70 of those initially selected questioned by Mr Justice Williams on their availability.
Proceedings were adjourned until today when it is expected a jury will be sworn in.
The two directors who appeared on behalf of the company in court were Gerald Ward and Maria Seage.
