The hearing, which runs through Wednesday, is one of the final regulatory hurdles in the electric utility's bid for approval of a new ash dump.
The Missouri Public Service Commission staff and the Office of Public Counsel issued a statement last week in support of Ameren's bid for a new place to store coal ash next to the Franklin County coal-fired plant. It could be May before the commission makes a final ruling, according to a commission schedule.
Ameren's proposal has faced resistance from environmental groups that worry about potential groundwater contamination from stored coal ash. They also worry about its location in the Missouri River floodway.
A local group, the Labadie Environmental Organization, and the Sierra Club both plan to testify against the proposal next week, citing the proposed landfill's "risk-prone" location in filings with the commission.
In addition to a ruling from the commission, Ameren needs a construction permit from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources before it starts the project. The DNR is hosting a public hearing on the proposal April 8 in Washington, Mo. It could issue a permit within the next few months.
