Mar 18, 2014 (Highlight Press:http://highlightpress.com Delivered by Newstex) http://www.highlightpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1210-Barra.jpgGeneral Motors' boss Mary Barra has admitted that the automaker hasn't lived up to its responsibilities in the wake of a fresh 1.5 million vehicle recall General Motors' most senior executive has broken silence in an uncharacteristic admission of failure, following the recall of over 1.5 million vehicles announced on Monday.
According to company boss Mary Barra, GM really has no excuse at all for the events that led to faulty ignition switching making their way into hundreds of thousands of vehicles - a problem that's already been blamed for a dozen fatalities. 'Something went wrong with our process in this instance, and terrible things happened,' said the GM chief executive while addressing employees via a video message. She also added that the catastrophic failure would lead to a new company-wide standard for investigating defects and issuing vehicle recalls. Since January, General Motors has been forced to recall no less than 3.1 million vehicles across the US and other various international markets. Monday's announcement brought confirmation that $300 million was being set aside by the automaker in order to address the costs of four primary recalls. According to Barra, General Motors will be 'conducting an intense review of our internal processes and will have more developments to announce as we move forward.'
