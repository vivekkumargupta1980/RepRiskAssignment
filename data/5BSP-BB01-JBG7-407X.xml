Chinese Arts & Crafts suspended sales of elephant ivory at its stores in China and Hong Kong beginning in mid-March, it said in a statement late Tuesday.
"Due to the adjustment of product mix, Chinese Arts & Crafts (H.K.) Ltd. has suspended the business of selling (elephant) ivory products at all Chinese Arts & Crafts branches," it said.
The World Wildlife Fund ranks China as the world's biggest end-market for illegal elephant ivory, and animal rights groups say demand there is fueling a surge in poaching in Africa.
Hong Kong, a free port on the country's southern coast, has long served as a key transshipment point for illegal tusks.
This "goes a long way towards stigmatizing the consumption of ivory and ivory products," Alex Hofford, program director for Hong Kong for Elephants and consultant for WildAid, said in a statement.
China, whose government-licensed ivory carving factories provide the basis for a legal trade, has been criticized for ignoring a parallel black market and being slow to enforce tough laws that could jail convicted smugglers for life.
Earlier this month, Yao Ming, a former NBA basketball star and delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, called for an end to ivory sales, saying "buying ivory is buying bullets," according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
About 22,000 elephants were killed illegally in 2012, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which banned trade in elephant ivory in 1989 and later allowed a limited amount to be sold.
The population of African elephants is estimated at 420,000 to 650,000.
Chinese Arts & Crafts, whose Hong Kong shops sell all kinds of ivory products, said it would now promote carvings from the tusks of mammoths, which have been extinct for about 10,000 years and so do not come under the elephant ivory trade ban.
"Mammoth ivory can be used as a cover for the illegal ivory trade, and the consumption of mammoth products can stimulate demand in African elephant ivory products," Hofford said, adding that the chain's decision was still a "commendable first step."
In January, China followed the U.S. and other countries in destroying contraband ivory by crushing 6.2 tons of confiscated tusks. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, said it would burn 28 tons of its seized ivory.
