In 2013, the River Road plant was convicted, and environmental compliance manager Mark Kamholz was found guilty of violating 11 counts of the Clean Air Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for releasing cancer-causing toxins into the air and dumping hazardous material on the ground. Skretny fined the company $12.5 million for those violations. The plant will also fund a 10-year, $11.4 million University at Buffalo study, where residents and plant employees can meet with doctors to determine whether their health was negatively impacted by Tonawanda Coke's actions.
The U.S. Attorney's office said the offenses were related to the release of coke oven gas containing benzene into the air through an unreported pressure relief valve. In addition, a coke-quenching tower was operated without baffles, a pollution control device required by Tonawanda Coke's Title V Clean Air Act permit designed to reduce particulate matter released into the air.
Multiple reports said that Skretny also required the company to pay $711,000 for air and soil testing that will focus on the effects of plant emissions on neighborhoods closest to the plant.
