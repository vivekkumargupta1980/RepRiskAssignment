Koza said in the statement that the authorities' request is unlawful and it will challenge the decision. In January, Koza decided to shut down its Mastra gold mine in the province of Gumushane. Koza said it would close the Mastra facility in order to keep its budget and growth performance at optimum levels against restrictions and unfavourable regulations in the mining industry in Turkey. Previously, the local authorities halted operations at Koza's Cukuralan field. The authorities said Koza did not have the required and proper licences and environmental permits for the field. However, Koza appealed to a court and operations at the field resumed.
Koza Group is also the owner of the Bugun newspaper and TV channel Kanalturk which became critical of the government amid the corruption scandal. Some media outlets argue that the orders for the closures of the gold fields are politically motivated because of the group's media outlets' coverage of the graft probe. Koza controlled media claims that the government attempts to block the graft probe.
