The lawsuit claims violations of federal and California antitrust and unfair competition laws. The lawsuit seeks damages to be determined at trial.
The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. It names Keurig Green Mountain Inc., formerly known as Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. and successor to GMCR's former wholly-owned subsidiary Keurig Inc., which is based in Reading, Mass.
Last May, the Business Journal reported, &nbsp; a Boston court ruled that Rogers did not infringe on the patents for Keurig's single-serve coffee product.
Keurig had sued the local company last year alleging that Rogers' single-serve OneCup line infringed on three of its patents. Rogers argued that its OneCup line, which it launched under its San Francisco Bay brand in fall 2011, was unique technology produced after years of research.
