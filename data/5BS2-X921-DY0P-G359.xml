The divisions highlight the mounting problems triggered by EPA's Feb. 28 request for the remand in order to have 60 days to better explain the rules' use of a controversial "upper prediction limit" (UPL) method for setting emissions limits in the regulations, creating questions over the fate of briefing slated to begin March 28 in suits over the rules. Some aspects of the rules would be remanded for much longer. An agency spokeswoman has said EPA would leave the implementation of the rules in place during the remand.
EPA says the temporary voluntary remand of the combustion regulations is necessary so that it can "supplement the record" for the rulemakings by addressing questions raised by a D.C. Circuit decision last August in National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA) v. EPA. That ruling raised questions over the UPL statistical method that the agency used to set air toxics limits when it only has a limited number of data points.
The agency used the UPL in setting its combustion air rules, which include a "major" source boiler maximum achievable control technology (MACT) air toxics rule, an "area" source boiler MACT for smaller units, and an emissions rule for commercial and industrial solid waste incinerators, all of which face pending suits. EPA also used the UPL in a sewage sludge incinerator rule, which was litigated and prompted the court's ruling in NACWA.
Separately, EPA is also asking the D.C. Circuit to remand part of its conventional air pollutant rule for new power plants in order to address the UPL ruling, which could create questions about the fate of that litigation.
In the litigation over the package of combustion air rules, a series of new legal filings by industry groups highlight the regulatory and legal confusion over the remand request, and also divisions among industry about how to resolve it. The boiler MACT rules' compliance date is Jan. 1, 2016, industry groups note, giving industry little time to comply and lending urgency to resolving the litigation and the implications for regulatory compliance.
The Council of Industrial Boiler Owners (CIBO), JELD-WEN, Inc., American Municipal Power, Inc.and the American Petroleum Institute in two March 13 filings with the court agree to a short suspension of the briefing schedule to allow the court to decide on EPA's request before opening briefs are due March 28.
But the industry groups would oppose any longer delay that would allow EPA to complete its remand. "EPA's motion introduces chaos in an already complicated proceeding and would compel sources to continue planning for compliance with standards that EPA admits may change," the groups say.
Industry Divisions
Other industry groups however split with that position, and are seeking vacatur of the rules. In two March 13 filings, the American Forest & Paper Association, American Wood Council, Biomass Power Association, National Association of Manufacturers, National Oilseed Processors Association, Rubber Manufacturers Association and American Chemistry Council call on EPA to vacate the affected UPL-derived standards.
"While Petitioners do not oppose EPA's request for the opportunity to reassess standards based on nine or fewer data points, Petitioners staunchly oppose EPA's inequitable request that those standards remain in effect during the pendency of the rulemaking needed to accomplish the reassessment," the groups say.
"Remand of the UPL Standards without vacatur -- the relief requested by EPA -- would require Petitioners to spend time and money complying with standards that, by EPA's own admission, were calculated in a legally indefensible manner," they add. Therefore, "Petitioners oppose the motion to remand the UPL Standards and request instead that those standards be severed from this litigation and vacated," the groups say.
They note that all the area source boiler emissions limits were derived from data sets with nine or fewer data points. Unlike CIBO, they oppose any pause in the briefing schedule while the court responds to EPA's remand request.
Eastman Chemical Company, meanwhile, in a March 13 filing supports a short suspension of briefing in order to allow the court to rule on EPA's remand motion, but also asks for "vacatur of all existing source emission standards that apply to coal-fired energy recovery units" of the type operated by the company.
An industry lawyer says that the "super-complex" nature of EPA's remand motion has split industry groups on how to proceed. As a result, "it looks like the current briefing schedule order will stay in place past March 28, which really is ridiculous."
Environmentalists, meanwhile, have asked the court for an extension until March 27 to file their response to the remand request, citing the complexity of the issues raised.
Remand Request
One issue on which industry groups and environmentalists appear to agree is that EPA in its remand request has picked a seemingly arbitrary yardstick to determine which UPL-based standards would be subject to a full notice-and-comment rulemaking, and which would only be subject to a 60-day remand for the agency. An EPA spokeswoman says the 60-day remand is necessary to "further explain, and thus strengthen, the technical analysis" behind the rules.
EPA says it will conduct the full rulemaking to revise individual emissions limits calculated using the UPL and nine or fewer data points such as smoke stack tests, and the 60-day remand for those using more data points.
But a second industry attorney says, "it is a mystery as to why EPA believes it can remand a portion of a limited number of these standards based on a definition of small data set that it has created with no support whatsoever and believes that it can reevaluate those standards using the UPL or some other statistical tools, but it doesn't need to reevaluate the standards that are based on . . . more than nine individual stack test runs."
The source says EPA should remand the rules in their entirety and extend compliance dates, and says the request to remand some emissions limits without public comment means that "the rules are going to be very vulnerable to legal challenge" once the agency finalizes any changes it will make to them.
An environmentalist source agrees on the arbitrary nature of the nine data-point cutoff, asking if use of the UPL is "something that can be papered over in 60 days in some cases and require substantial analysis in other cases." Environmentalists generally oppose the UPL, which they say does not meet requirements of the Clean Air Act and leads to weaker standards than would otherwise apply. However, they have historically been reluctant to ask for vacatur of emissions limits, preferring remand to having no standards in place.
The D.C. Circuit's real concern in the NACWA ruling, the environmentalist says, is "about how EPA interprets the statute and I don't see how that would change based on the size of the data set."
The source says that aside from the legality of remanding some emissions limits without notice and comment, "I question whether that is a tenable moral position." -- Stuart Parker (sparker@iwpnews.com) & Chris Knight(cknight@iwpnews.com)
