10 March 2014 - French diversified group Bouygues SA (EPA:EN) said that it is in exclusive talks to sell a mobile phone network to Iliad SA's (EPA:ILD) arm Free Mobile SAS for up to EUR1.8bn (USD2.5bn), as part of efforts to address competition issues in relation to a proposed merger between Bouygues Telecom SA and Vivendi SA's (EPA:VIV) telecom unit SFR.
The disposal, which would also include a portfolio of frequencies, would be subject to the completion of the SFR merger, Bouygues said.
Martin Bouygues commented that the transaction would enable his company to submit to the antitrust regulator a merger plan with measures that ensure "strong, infrastructure-based competition" on the French mobile phone market.
Last week Bouygues said it had submitted an offer to buy SFR in exchange for EUR10.5bn in cash and a 46% stake in the combined firm and urged Vivendi to engage in talks over a combination of SFR with Bouygues Telecom. The offer values SFR at EUR14.5bn before synergies and at almost EUR19bn after synergies, Bouygues has said. It plans cover the cash consideration of the offer with the debt of the new entity, which would be fully underwritten by HSBC plc (LON:HSBA).Country: FranceSector: TelecommunicationsTarget: Mobile phone networkBuyer: Free Mobile SAS, Iliad SAVendor: Bouygues SA , Bouygues Telecom SADeal size in USD: 2.5bnType: Divestment, MergerFinancing: Cash & Stock, DebtStatus: Bidding, Talks, ExclusivityComment: Bouygues's offer values SFR at USD19.9bn before synergies., The USD2.5bn deal size refers to the maximum price for Bouygues's mobile network to Free.
