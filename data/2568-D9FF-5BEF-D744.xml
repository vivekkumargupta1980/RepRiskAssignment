The agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency will allow BP, which had been the Pentagon's biggest fuel supplier, to seek lucrative federal contracts again and bid for oil exploration leases. Next week, a U.S. auction is set for the right to drill in the Gulf, where the Londonbased company is the secondlargest producer.
The end of the suspension is a milestone in BP's recovery from the worst U.S. offshore oil spill, which forced it to sell about US$38-billion in assets to meet the costs of cleaning up pollution and compensating victims. A judge in New Orleans is considering BP's degree of responsibility for the disaster and the scale of fines to impose under the Clean Water Act.
"It marks another step, in our view, toward the rehabilitation of BP's reputation, standing and position in the key North American market," analysts at Deutsche Bank AG said in a note to clients Friday. The timing is "helpful" given the upcoming licensing round, they said.
Tyson Slocum, director of the Public Citizen's Energy Program in Washington, said the decision was premature.
This "lets a corporate felon and repeat offender off the hook for its crimes against people and the environment," Mr. Slocum said in a statement.
