The global financial institutions broke certain swaps contracts they had entered into with the now-closed banks, by separately colluding to rig the Libor rate to which the contracts were tied, the FDIC said. Some of the banks accused in the lawsuit, including Barclays and UBS, have already paid some US$6 billion to resolve charges from U.S. and European authorities that they worked to manipulate benchmark interest rates. They have also been sued by investors and others who claim they lost money due to the manipulation. A federal judge last March dismissed many of those claims that were based on antitrust law, but has yet to rule on cases that rely on the “breach of contract” theory used by the FDIC.(SD-Agencies)
