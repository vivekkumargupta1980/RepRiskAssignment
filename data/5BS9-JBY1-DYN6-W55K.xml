The lawsuit against United Bulk Terminals alleges coal and petroleum coke fall daily from its conveyor belts at Davant (duh-VAHNT) and onto the river bank or into the Mississippi.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
The groups charge the company is ignoring state law, which requires immediate cleanup of spilled materials.
The groups seek fines against United Bulk under the federal Clean Water Act and want the company to be ordered to clean the river and its bank.
The United Bulk facility is one of the nation's two largest coal transport terminals, according to the Plaquemines (PLAK-uh-minz) Port, Harbor and Terminal District.
