But Boral has been quick to discount the fears, assuring the community there is no risk.
Ernie Ewert's family has bred and trained race horses from their Sheahan Rd property for more than 50 years, relying on the mineral-rich groundwater for their prized stock.
And he's concerned that an expansion will not only increase the already unbearable smell, but leaching could contaminate water relied on by nearby farmers.
He said for years the area has been spruiked and built up to be a beautiful place to live.
"Caroline Springs has been built, there are residential developments planned for the next 5-10 years - a tip this size is not an incentive for investment," Mr Ewert said.
Neighbour and mum of four Daniela Budinoska said she feared for the future health of her children.
"We moved here three years ago for fresh air for the children and a semi-rural lifestyle, a monster tip is not what we signed up for," she said.
Boral Waste Solutions business manager Richard McCarthy assured residents the company was committed to its regulatory, environmental and safety obligations.
He said each waste "cell" was lined with clay and a high-density polythene liner was welded to each cell to prevent water leaching.
"And the groundwater is continuously monitored in accordance with the EPA guidelines and routinely audited," Mr McCarthy said.
He also reiterated the landfill does not and is not proposing to accept asbestos, liquids and toxic or hazardous waste.
The campaign to convince Melton councillors to reject an expansion continues to gain momentum, with more than 1700 objections received by the council and more than 2500 signatures on a petition set to be presented to the Legislative Council in coming weeks.The application is expected to come before the council in the first half of this year.
