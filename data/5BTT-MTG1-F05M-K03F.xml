According to a news release, Tennessee will receive $2.8 million from the agreement.
"My office is happy that Tennesseans will receive this compensation soon," Tennessee Attorney General Bob Cooper said in the news release. "Unfortunately, it took approximately three years to prove consumers paid millions of dollars more than they should have because these companies conspired to artificially raise the price of e-books."
E-book publishers involved in the deal include: Hachette Book Group Inc., HarperCollins Publishers LLC, Simon & Schuster Inc., Holtzbrinck Publishers LLC (d/b/a Macmillan), and Penguin Group (USA) Inc.
The following are excerpts from today's news release:
It has not yet been determined how many Tennesseans will receive funds. As part of the agreement, consumers will receive an account credit or check based on the number of eligible E-books they bought during the claims period (April 1, 2010 to May 21, 2012). Whether a consumer receives a credit or check depends on the retailer through which consumers bought their E-books. In certain circumstances, the payment depends upon whether a claim was properly filed or on whether a consumer specifically requested a check. Eligible consumers should review their email for communications from their E-book retailer, or from the Settlement Administrator, regarding account credits or checks.

Apple declined to settle the claims against it, and the District Court conducted a three-week trial in June 2013. Following that trial, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote found that Apple played a central role in facilitating and executing a conspiracy to eliminate retail price competition in order to raise e-book prices, in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. A second trial to determine the amount of damages Apple must pay for that violation has been tentatively scheduled for May. If successful, additional account credits or checks will be distributed to Tennessee consumers in the future.
