It's already known that CSEC has spied on thousands of law-abiding air travellers and even followed their movements for weeks. It is shocking how this government agency is using tax money to spy on us.
We're on the hook for $850 million to pay for CSEC this year alone, and more than $1 billion to build it a lavish new headquarters.
The type of data CSEC is collecting on us can reveal everything from our financial status, to our medical history - even our sexual orientation and religious and political beliefs. More than 150,000 Canadians spoke out against this government and then minister Vic Toews on their last attempt at online spying on law abiding Canadians.
Now the government is using CSEC to spy on us and covering its tracks with Bill C-13, which gives the telecom providers immunity for handing over our private information without a warrant.
Privacy is a fundamental right in any healthy democracy. CSEC's activities are making our personal information more susceptible to identity theft and vulnerable to attacks by criminals. CSEC works hand in hand with the NSA, and has even let the NSA set up a massive illegal spying operation on Canadian soil during the Toronto G-20.
Ask local Conservative ministers of state Lynne Yelich and Kelly Block for their government to allow democracy to return to Canada.
