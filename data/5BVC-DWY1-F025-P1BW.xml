The factories, power plants and other operations released 32.7 million pounds of the potentially dangerous chemicals, down from 39.2 million pounds in 2011.
"It's a significant decline," said state Department of Environment of Environmental Quality spokesman Bill Hayden. "It shows the ongoing progress we've made to get reductions in these kinds of chemicals. It's definitely good news for people and the environment."
The numbers are in the annual Toxics Release Inventory that the DEQ issued Wednesday.
The chemicals were released into the air or waters or were buried. The pollutants include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, ammonia, lead, mercury, arsenic and copper.
The chemicals are considered so potent that, in sufficient concentrations, they could kill or cause cancer, reproductive problems or other disorders in people, fish or wildlife.
Glen Besa, director of the Sierra Club's Virginia chapter, said the drop in pollution is good but doesn't tell the whole story. "These toxic releases are concentrated in a few communities that bear the greatest burden of this pollution."
He added, "Places like Radford, Hopewell, Chesterfield and Richmond have the greatest concentration of industries releasing these toxic chemicals, and we urge DEQ to work with the industries and communities to further reduce this pollution."
The chemical emissions are legal. But by publicizing the pollution, the federally required toxic-release reports are designed to encourage industries to get cleaner.
Hayden said spot checks by DEQ indicate the releases dropped because, among other things, some industries began using less-dangerous chemicals, and some power plants installed federally required pollution controls.
"There is no single reason," Hayden said.
Many of the chemicals become diluted in air and water, and it's unclear how these releases are affecting people.
The toxic-release report does not delve into potential health concerns, Hayden said. "However, virtually all the releases come under DEQ permits, which are designed to protect human health and the environment."
BAE Systems in Montgomery County, operator of the Radford Army Ammunition Plant, was tops in toxic releases at 7.69 million pounds.
That made Montgomery the top locality for toxic emissions with 7.73 million pounds.
A Perdue Farms' poultry processing plant at Accomac in Accomack County was the No. 2 site in releases with 2.5 million pounds.
Rounding out the top five operations in toxic emissions were Honeywell International Inc.'s plant in Hopewell (1.9 million pounds); Philip Morris USA's Park 500 site in Chesterfield County (1.4 million pounds); and Jewell Coke Co. in Buchanan County (1.3 million pounds).
Among localities, Chesterfield was No. 2 in toxic releases, with 3.7 million pounds. Hopewell, Accomack and Buchanan rounded out the top five localities in emissions.
Among 96 localities that had toxic releases, Richmond came in 12th; Hanover County, 21st; and Henrico County, 48th.
