A jury at Winchester Crown Court convicted 52-year-old Debbie Vincent of being involved in the conspiracy run by the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty group against Cambridge-based Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS) during a ten-year period.
Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, told the trial that the protests - which targeted suppliers and customers of HLS - included accusing staff members falsely of being paedophiles, sending incendiary devices and hoax bombs, posting sanitary towels claimed to be infected with Aids, and causing criminal damage to people's homes and cars.
Mr Bowes said that the aim of the campaign was to put HLS out of business through cutting off its suppliers by creating a "climate of fear". Vincent was arrested in July 2012 at the same time as Swiss-born Sven van Hasselt and British woman Natasha Simpkins, born in Germany, who were detained in the Netherlands and are still awaiting extradition to the UK to face the same charge.
She will be sentenced on April 17 and was released on bail until then.
