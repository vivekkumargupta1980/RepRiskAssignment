(AP) - A Duson businessman has been charged in an ongoing federal probe of bid-rigging and bribery at the public housing authorities in Opelousas and Lafayette.
The Advocate reports (http://bit.ly/1j2MQP7 ) Kendall T. Anderson, of Anderson Iron Works, faces one count of misprision of a felony for allegedly not reporting bid-rigging at the Opelousas Housing Authority.
Anderson's company has done construction work for the housing authorities in Opelousas and Lafayette, as well as for the city of Opelousas.
Federal prosecutors have not elaborated on the specifics of the allegations against him, other than to allege in court filings that he was aware of and failed to report the illegal actions of Garnette L. Thomas, a former Opelousas Housing Authority employee who pleaded guilty last year to wire fraud in the investigation.
Thomas admitted using letterheads from contractors who had not actually bid on projects to create phony bid documents, giving the impression that contracts were awarded through the competitive bid process that was legally required for the public projects.
It is unclear from the court record whether or not those contracts were steered to Anderson.
Anderson Iron Works was the recipient of contracts with Opelousas that were highlighted in a 2011 state audit that found possible violations of the state's public bid laws.
Anderson referred comment to his attorney, Donald Washington, who did not return a message left at his office.
