The province's anti-corruption squad raided Liberal party headquarters last July, which led them to businesses owned by Marc Bibeau, the Liberal's chief fundraiser. UPAC raided Bibeau's companies Shockbeton and Saramac in November.
Among the items listed in the search warrants are several emails concerning envelopes given to Schokbeton.
Some of the material seized revealed that $428,000 was raised at one event, yet that amount doesn't appear in the Liberal's financial statements, PQ candidate Pierre Duschene said Tuesday.
"Why are they hiding that?" he said at a news conference.
He said the PQ would like answers from Liberal Leader Philippe Couillard about where the money came from and why it doesn't appear in the party's financial statements.
"Is it being used in the current election campaign?" Duschene asked.
When the information became public March 3, Bibeau issued a statement, saying he had done nothing illegal.
The PQ called a news conference about the finances Tuesday, the day a new poll showed the Liberals strengthening their lead in the April 7 election.
"We took the time to analyze the information," Duschene said. "We're on the eve of an election and a return of the Liberals to power could be like a long visit to the dentist with a drill in the molars."
