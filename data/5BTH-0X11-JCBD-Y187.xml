The Brighton Pavilion MP was held outside energy firm Cuadrilla's exploratory oil drilling site on the outskirts of Balcombe on August 19 last year.
Last October, Lucas, 53, denied two charges - wilful obstruction of the highway and breaching section 14 of the Public Order Act.
She is due to stand trial alongside four others. Last summer the Cuadrilla site became a national focal point for anti-fracking protesters fearful of the potential impact of the extraction method.
Hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves pumping water and chemicals deep into the ground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas.
Opponents to the method have voiced fears that it could harm water resources, the surrounding environment and cause small earthquakes.
Cuadrilla later announced that it had no intention of fracking at Balcombe ``now or in the future'', saying that the rock beneath the site was already naturally fractured.
It was revealed in January that the cost to taxpayers of policing the lengthy anti-fracking protests in West Sussex was nearly Â£4 million.
It led Sussex police and crime commissioner Katy Bourne to submit an application to the Home Office in a bid to recover the cost.
The trial, at Brighton Magistrates' Court, is expected to last for five days.
In a message posted on her website, Lucas said it was ``reasonable'' and ``morally necessary'' to use peaceful means to try to stop a process that could cause ``enormous harm''.
She said she would not be using public funds to fight her case, adding that she would not let it affect her parliamentary and constituency work.
In the online message, she said: ``As an MP, I'm in the privileged position of being able to make the case in Parliament.
``I've tabled motions, championed debates, put questions to ministers, and spoken out in the media - and will continue to do so.
``But the Government is ignoring the evidence, ignoring the climate science, and ignoring the enormous benefits of a secure and affordable energy system based on renewables and efficiency.
``Instead, they are offering the fossil fuel companies generous tax breaks as well as senior roles within Government itself.''
She added: ``The window for action is closing fast.
``As a result, I decided to join the peaceful protest to send a clear message to the Government, as well as to support and join those people at the proposed fracking site in Balcombe who were standing up to be counted.
``There is a proud tradition of non-violent direct action in this country, and I believe that using peaceful means to try to stop a process that could cause enormous harm is not only reasonable but also morally necessary.''
