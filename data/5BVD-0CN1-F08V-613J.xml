A local advocacy group said a subcontractor has retaliated against employees who lodged the complaint, which accuses it of failing to protect them from mold, lead and asbestos contamination. Durr Heavy Construction, the contractor in charge of the project to redevelop the old Iberville housing development, bears ultimate responsibility for protecting the workers and preventing retaliation, according to the advocacy group.
Durr denied the allegations and said it is cooperating with the investigation. OSHA hasn't issued a final report, but investigators have not notified Durr of any violations, according to a statement from the company.
Construction workers Patrick Delaney and Reginald Junior joined a protest this month against Durr and its subcontractors, accusing them of substandard work conditions and low pay. Aided by Stand With Dignity, the group that organized the protest, they also filed a complaint to OSHA in Baton Rouge.
OSHA followed up on March 20 with an on-site investigation.
In a "whistle-blower complaint" to OSHA dated March 25, Stand said that Delaney has since been subjected to threats and reprimands. A supervisor with Abatement Construction & Services Contractor, the subcontractor that Delaney works for, went so far as to threaten his life, according to the complaint.
ACSC, based in New Orleans, has not returned a message requesting comment.
