(AP) - Dozens of western Pennsylvania organizations are asking state health officials to require that a Pittsburgh-area coke plant reduce emissions or close.
The 36-member coalition including small businesses and unions sent a letter to the Allegheny County health department about the issue, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported (http://bit.ly/1gis63G ).
The groups said the Shenango Inc. plant has a 35-year history of air pollution violations and was in violation of county air quality standards on 330 out of 432 days, a period that ended in September.
"How is Shenango allowed to pay fine after fine for these numerous violations and not get shut down?" asked Aaron Stubna, the owner of the Lincoln Barbershop in Bellevue, at a news conference Thursday. "The state will shut down my barbershop for minor violations."
Health department spokesman Dave Zazac said officials would review the letter and respond to the organizations individually.
Randi Berris, a spokeswoman for parent company DTE Energy Services of Ann Arbor, Mich., said the firm is negotiating with the county about its air emissions.
"We're working on our long-term environmental performance as we have been doing since we purchased the plant in 2008," she said.
The plant has been the subject of a number of consent orders for the past two decades. In 2012, the company agreed to pay $1.75 million in a settlement with federal environmental officials over persistent air and water pollution violations.
The plant includes 56 ovens and processes 1,500 tons of coal per day in the production of coke, a fuel used to make steel.
