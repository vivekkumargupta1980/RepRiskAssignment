The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued new rules regulating vehicle emission standards and the sulfur content of gasoline in an effort to further reduce air pollution in the U.S. The rules requiring gasoline refineries to reduce the level of sulfur in gasoline by approximately two-thirds by 2017 were announced on March 3. Tailpipe emission standards will be phased-in between model years 2017 and 2025.
The new regulations, similar to regulations in place in other countries, are designed to reduce tailpipe and evaporative emissions from passenger cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty passenger vehicles and some heavy-duty vehicles. They also will help emission control systems work more effectively. According to Gina McCarthy, EPAs Administrator, the new standards will reduce pollutionclean the air we breathe and protect the health of American families.
Tailpipe emissions are linked to smog and health conditions such as asthma, lung disease and heart conditions. The EPA projects that by 2030, the new regulations will save between $7 billion and $19 billion annually in health care costs.
When these regulations were still in the review stage last year, Wespath provided input in support of the stricter standards, stating that the new regulations will help create and/or retain shareholder value of our investments, while also offering environmental and social benefits, a powerful combination.
