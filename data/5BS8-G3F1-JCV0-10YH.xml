The world's biggest auto maker said the move would see the lockout of about 6 400 employees at the factories in southern India.
Company and union officials had been trying to sign|a new contract for the past 10 months, with the local government helping to mediate the negotiations.
"In the meantime, under the instigation of the union, certain sections of the employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors, thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days," Toyota said.
"All these unlawful activities have been detailed in the lockout notice. With this background, the company is left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel," it added.
The two factories, near the city of Bangalore, produce about 310 000 units a year, mostly for the domestic market. - Sapa-AFP
