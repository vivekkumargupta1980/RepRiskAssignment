A court heard that the pair were injured when hot material from an industrial drier hit them as they tried to tackle a blaze at Maxibrite coal briquette plant in Llantrisant on December 2012.
The incident was investigated by HSE and the firm was prosecuted at Pontypridd Magistrates' Court on Friday.
Employee Carl Lewis opened the hatch but hot cinders cascaded out, burning works manager Simon Gilbody on the chest, neck and face but without causing serious injury, the court was told.
The court heard that as Mr Lewis tried to close the hatch, he was himself engulfed by hot coals. After showering for 30 minutes he was taken to hospital and received skin grafts.
HSE's investigation found Maxibrite had not carried out a suitable risk assessment and failed to provide a safe way of working.
The firm, of Durham, was fined £20,000 with £5,115 costs after admitting a breach of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and a single breach of the Management of Health and Safety at Work.
