We appreciate her effort, write to discourage use, and ask public servants to put community health first. Economics is driving coal ash use but that is a short-sighted decision.
It's more than a "mess in the garage." It's the combined residue of "bottom waste" plus "fly ash." Current law doesn't allow coal burning facilities to put this in our air, why permit these materials on our streets? It's not harmless and inert. If you stand on any local street, you will see the fine mist thrown up by passing tires. A combination of coal ash, with its heavy metals, and melting snow which is inhaled by all breathing passers-by.
We all know those that use a medical inhaler for asthma, or COPD. What happens to any of us walking to get coffee or transact business as we pass through aerosol-ized coal ash? What happens on a windy day? We inhale particles with no knowledge of long-term consequences.
We should look to others to avoid costly clean-ups and lawsuits. A December 2008 Maryland court decision cost Constellation Energy $54 million, which had performed a "restoration project", filling an abandoned gravel quarry with fly ash; the ash contaminated area water wells with heavy metals. C&EN/12 Feb. 2009, p. 45
The Federal government is developing rules for oversight concerning disposal of this waste, available by December 14, 2014. We suggest delaying further use of coal ash until those are published. Let us make wise long-term decisions that keep us and our children healthy.
