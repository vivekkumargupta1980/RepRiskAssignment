The locations in Palmetto and Deland were inspected last August, the department said in a statement. At Thatcher Chemical's Palmetto site, inspectors found discharges of pollutants on the ground and into the stormwater management system near that facility. Thatcher Chemical is located on Inland Transport St. off of U.S. 41.
At the Deland site, the department said the company buried 100,000 to 200,000 pounds of ferric sulfate sludge in a wooded area. Thatcher, a chemical manufacturer with locations nationwide, will be forced to pay civil penalties of over $230,000 and make corrective actions, the DEP said in a statement.
"The Department of Environmental Protection takes our role of protecting public health and the environment serious and we are committed to making sure facilities are in compliance with applicable regulations," said Jeff Prather, director of DEP's Central District. "When a business takes actions that are calculated, grossly negligent, and potentially harmful to the environment, we will pursue formal enforcement with maximum penalties." &nbsp;
