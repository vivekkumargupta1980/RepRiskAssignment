"Only the government can help us get back habitats."At the human chain, the blind also chanted slogans against Babul's repression of them and urged immediate rehabilitation of the evicted families.The blind held banners and placards inscribed with slogans demanding compensation and rehabilitation of those victimised by Babul during the establishment of 'Hunter' beer factory in Kaliakoir upazila.Visually impaired Mojibor Rahman, general secretary of Gazipur district unit of National Blind Welfare Association, said, forest department gave 14 bighas of land to 45 blind families. The blind built a village named 'Ondhertek Palli' there. But Babul grabbed the land and built a factory to produce Hunter beer."The blind were living on the land peacefully," Mojibor said in his narrative. "But things went awry in 2001 when Babul and his gong turned up one day.
They evicted the visually impaired people from their homesteads."Three blind people-Salim, Barek and Safaj Uddin-were allegedly killed by Babul and his aides as they protested the land grabbing, he mentioned.Another visually impaired, Jalil Uddin, cried his eyes out and said, "Even, the blind like us were not immune from Babul's cruel clutches.
We have become destitute losing our last resort. We're now passing our days either on footpaths or under trees. We're yet to get back our land despite repeated requests to the authorities concerned."Babul and his associates are still at large in spite of the killings, he went on saying. "One day Babul's cadres came to kill us by running a truck over us. However, we narrowly escaped. As Babul occupied our land, our curse is on him. The Almighty Allah will punish him."Jainal Abedin, president of Gazipur Social Welfare Rehabilitation Association, said they founded the Blind Welfare Association in 1985.
