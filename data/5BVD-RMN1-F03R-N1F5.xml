Mar 28, 2014 (IT Pro:http://www.itpro.co.uk Delivered by Newstex) Apple, Google and two other Silicon Valley companies are getting closer to reaching a settlement in a lawsuit where tech workers allege the companies conspired to not poach each other's staff to drive down wages.
At a federal court hearing in San Jose, California, Google attorney Robert Van Nest said the companies and plaintiffs have been consulting daily with a mediator to resolve the dispute, and that they are making progress. Kelly Dermody, an attorney for the plaintiffs, agreed with the assessment. Roughly 60,000 tech workers won permission to sue as a class action. The trial is currently scheduled to begin in May. The case began in 2011 when five software engineers sued Apple, Google, Adobe Systems, Intel and others over an alleged conspiracy to suppress pay by agreeing not to recruit or hire each other's employees. These defendants were accused of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act antitrust laws by conspiring to eliminate competition for labour, depriving workers of job mobility and hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation. The case has been closely watched by Silicon Valley, with much of it built on emails among top executives, including the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs and former Google chief Eric Schmidt. Walt Disney's Pixar and Lucasfilm units and Intuit have already agreed to a settlement, with Disney paying about $9 million and Intuit paying $11 million.
