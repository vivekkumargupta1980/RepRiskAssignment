A class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey by another law firm on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of The Medicines Company (NASDAQ: MDCO) between February 20, 2013 and February 12, 2014, inclusive (the "Class Period").
During the Class Period one of the Company's late stage products in development was cangrelor, which is intended to prevent platelet activation and aggregation in patients undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Interventions ("PCI") such as angioplasties. The Company conducted a series of three CHAMPION trials, including CHAMPION PCI, CHAMPION PLATFORM and CHAMPION PHOENIX, to test the efficacy and safety of the product to decrease thrombotic events, such as blood clots, either during or after PCI. The CHAMPION PHOENIX trial tested the efficacy of cangrelor as compared to clopidogrel, a competing drug manufactured by Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi, under the trade name Plavix.
The complaint alleges that MDCO and certain of its officers and directors ("Defendants") "touted the results" of the CHAMPION trials, claiming "statistically significant" results which had met the trials' primary endpoints." Regarding the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial, Defendants claimed that the trial demonstrated that the use of both cangrelor and Plavix significantly reduced thrombotic events within 48 hours of PCI when compared to the use of Plavix alone. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that: (1) cangrelor did not show superiority versus Plavix; (2) the clinical trials sponsored by the Company were unethically and inappropriately conducted, including by delaying the administration of Plavix and lowering the Plavix dosage of patients in the control arm; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' Class Period statements were materially false and misleading.
The case was brought following the drop in MDCO shares after the February 10, 2014 release of FDA briefing documents regarding the vote by the FDA's Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee ("CRDAC"), which raised questions about and criticized the ethicality and other aspects of the conduct of the MDCO's clinical trial for cangrelor. MDCO shares fell from $34.22 to $32.42 on February 10. On February 13, CRDAC voted 7-2 against recommending approval of cangrelor. The price of MDCO shares fell from $33.10 to $29.28 when trading resumed after the CRDAC vote on February 13.
