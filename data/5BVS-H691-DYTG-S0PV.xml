I’m considering stock in water bottling companies.
The Duke spill highlights the danger of poorly regulated coal ash ponds. With over 1,000 coal ash sites nationally, the potential for spills is considerable, and spills will drive up consumer fears and the demand for bottled water. Consumers have learned that the coal ash toxins released into the water supply contain arsenic, lead, aluminum and mercury, posing a rick to all major human organs.
West Virginia’s Elk River chemical spill of the coal washing chemical may be a harbinger of a different kind of chemical contamination. Our rivers as corridors of commerce have long had chemical plants and storage tanks nearby, some discharging industrial waste products such as cyanide, zinc, lead, copper and mercury.
Fracking has become a new concern for water consumers. The extraction uses thousands of gallons of water and undisclosed chemicals (a trade secret), including known carcinogens and toxins.
Contamination of the groundwater and fouled rivers will force consumers to buy the “safer” bottled water, increasing profits and dividends.
