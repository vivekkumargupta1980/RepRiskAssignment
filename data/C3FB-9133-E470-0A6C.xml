The move came following the failure of wage negotiations between the management and the union.
According to a statement by the company, the management and the union have been discussing the charter of demands for 2013-14 for the past 10 months.
"On the instigation of the union, certain employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line and have been threatening supervisors, thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days. All these unlawful activities have been detailed in the lockout notice," the company said.
Additional Labour Commissioner J T Jinkalappa said, "The workers were demanding a '4,000 pm hike. For over two months, a two-hour strike every day dented production. Both the union and management will be called on Monday to settle the dispute."
A senior officer from Bidadi police station told Express that there will be security around the factory to prevent any untoward incidents.
The Toyota Kirloskar Motors (TKM) plants at Bidadi, located on the outskirts of Bangalore, employ over 6,400 people.
The company produces their flagship Innova models and Fortuner in the first plant while it has been rolling out Corolla Altis, Etios, Etios Liva and Camry from the second plant.
