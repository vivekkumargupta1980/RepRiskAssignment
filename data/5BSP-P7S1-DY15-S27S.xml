Justice Lateefat Okunnu described Oyedepo's absence from the proceedings as a waste of tax payers money and the court's time.
Also, the judge rejected the oral applications made by the three defendants; Abdullahi Alao, Olarenwaju Olalusi and Opeyemi Ajuyah to strike out the charge due to lack of diligent prosecution.
The trio are being prosecuted alongside their companies; Majope Investment Ltd and Axenergy Ltd by the anti-graft agency.
Counsels to the defendants, Oludare Falana and Mr Aderemi Oguntoye, had moved motion on the application, urging the court to strike out the charge.
They argued that the absence of the prosecution violated Section 232 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Lagos State, 2011, which provides for speedy dispensation of criminal cases.
Similarly, Justice Okunnu in another ruling, granted permission to Olanrewaju Olalusi, one of the three defendants, to travel to United Kingdom to represent his employers at a business engagement.
Okunnu asked the court's chief registrar to release Olalusi's international passport for the purpose of the journey, adding that he was free to embark on the trip from April 8, 2014.
The judge consequently vacated the April 14 and 15 dates earlier slated for the trial.
She however directed Olalusi to return to Nigeria not later than April 21 and must also return his international passport within 48 hours of his return to the chief registrar. The matter was adjourned till March 24.
