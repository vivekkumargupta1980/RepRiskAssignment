Next in line was the sanitation sector, with nine sanctions, energy with eight, and real estate and fishing and aquaculture with seven each.
SMA said that in 2013 the agency carried out 435 inspections of projects, of which 39 resulted in a sanctioning process. Of the remaining 31 sanctions, 27 were the result of third party complaints, while four were self-reported.
The sanctions against mining companies include those handed to Canadian miner Barrick Gold's (TSX. NYSE: ABX) Pascua Lama project, which received the largest environmental fines imposed in Chile at a total of some US$16mn.
Other mining sector sanctions include that for Canadian Teck Resources' (NYSE: TCK) Quebrada Blanca mine, which was the subject of the first charges filed by SMA and has since been ruled satisfactory; Kinross Gold's (TSX: K, NYSE: KGC) Maricunga unit; and local coal miner Minera Invierno, a JV between holding Copec and shipping company Ultramar.
Last year the agency received 1,640 complaints, the majority of which had to do with excessive noise, water pollution and foul odors, the SMA said.
