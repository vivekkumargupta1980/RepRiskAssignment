Mar 25, 2014 (Honolulu Civil Beat:http://civilbeat.com Delivered by Newstex) Four years after Global Horizons[1] was implicated in the largest human trafficking case in U.S. history, a federal judge has found the California labor-contracting company liable for harassing, discriminating against and retaliating against more than 500 Thai laborers working on Hawaii farms. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brought the case against the company after years of investigating its poor treatment of Thai workers. Mordechai Orian, CEO of Global Horizons, told Civil Beat[2] Monday that he couldn't comment because he hadn't yet read the court's decision. The EEOC's civil case follows a failed criminal prosecution against Orian and other executives managing farms in Hawaii. [1]: http://gmpusa.com/ [2]: http://www.civilbeat.com/topics/civil-beat/
