The lender employs the daughter of Shenzhen-based China General Nuclear's chairman He Yu and has helped the Chinese firm for the IPO for around nine months. The company had started working for China General Nuclear before employing the chairman's daughter.
Late last year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested the company to provide information on its hiring practices. No allegations of wrongdoing have been made.
Last year, the U.S. had opened a criminal investigation into whether JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) violated anti-bribery laws by giving jobs to children of prominent people in China. Since that probe, JPM reportedly dropped out of two share sales for Chinese firms.
The stock settled up 1.3 percent on the Xetra on Friday at 32.31 euros.
