Kempton Park businessman Takalani Tshivhase appeared in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crime Court yesterday on a charge of corruption, Hawks spokesman Captain Paul Ramaloko said. The case was postponed to April 24.
"This arrest should serve as a reminder to companies doing business with the government that corruption is not an option in securing business deals," said Hawks chief Lieutenant-General Anwa Dramat.
The Hawks arrested Tshivhase on March 5 at his Kempton Park office. He appeared in court and was released on bail of R10 000 the same day, Ramaloko said.
"The accused allegedly offered a lieutenant-general in the technology management environment of the SAPS R5m to secure a multimillion-rand tender for Pinnacle Holdings. The lieutenant-general's office had advertised the tender," said Ramaloko. He was not available to provide more details.
Tshivhase declined to comment. He is director of several businesses, including Pinnacle.
"The SAPS previously contracted the company to provide field terminals," said Ramaloko.
Yesterday, Sharenet reported that Tshivhase sold R4m in Pinnacle shares on March 19.
