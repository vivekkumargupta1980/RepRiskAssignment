Permanent repairs are to begin once the dam has been sufficiently stabilized.
Duke spokesman Dave Scanzoni says there is not a specific timetable for how long it will take to complete the temporary repair. "We will work as quickly and safely as is feasible," he says.
The work on that repair began Thursday, before the&nbsp;N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources&nbsp;gave its formal approval Friday. Duke has not yet developed its plan for the permanent repair, Scanzoni says.
A four-inch wide crack almost 35 feet long developed in the dam this week. The dam was built in 1985 to form the largest of five ash ponds at the plant, which was retired in 2012.
DENR says Duke will block a pipe in the pond to prevent water from escaping while the work is done. It will dig out the section of the earthen dam with the crack in it and put in the temporary patch. The excavation must proceed slowly, the state says, to avoid additional damage.
Scanzoni emphasizes that the base of the dam remains stable.
On Thursday, DENR cited Duke for violating state environmental regulations at the site by pumping about 61 million gallons of wastewater into the Cape Fear River from the 1985 ash pond and another pond on the site. Duke has about 30 days to respond to the citation.
