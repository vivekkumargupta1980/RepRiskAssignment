Former IOR Director General Paolo Cipriani and deputy Massimo Tulli quit their positions in July, days after the arrest of a high-ranking Vatican prelate who allegedly used the bank to launder money on behalf of wealthy family friends.
Tulli and Cipriani are accused of having broken anti-money laundering law in connection to the transfer of 23 million euros (31.5 million dollars) from an account IOR held at a Rome branch of Credito Artigiano, part of Milan-based Credito Valtellinese.
The date for the start of their trial has yet to be fixed.
Italian authorities seized the funds in 2010, holding on to them for about one year.
They became suspicious following attempts to move 20 million euros to an account held at a Frankfurt, Germany, branch of the bank JP Morgan, and the other 3 million euros to an account of the Italian bank Banca del Fucino.
Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, who was IOR president at the time, was also placed under investigation, but he was cleared from all allegations of wrongdoing last month. Gotti Tedeschi was ousted from the Vatican bank in 2012, in a decision that was never fully explained.
Under Pope Francis, efforts to clean up Vatican finances have been stepped up. In January he overhauled the membership of the panel of cardinals that oversees the IOR, while last month he created a new economy secretariat headed by tough Australian Cardinal George Pell.
