The European Parliament had already endorsed the reforms last month.
Officials hope they will help discourage young people from starting to smoke. The new legislation will require tobacco companies to cover 65 per cent of the front and back of their packages with health warnings, including graphic photos, including of diseases caused by smoking. Countries wishing to introduce plain packaging could do so. Flavoured tobacco products with high sales volumes will be banned. There will be a phase-out period for the popular menthol cigarettes, which will be prohibited from 2020. E-cigarettes will also be regulated, although efforts to have them classified across the board as medicinal products failed. Slim cigarettes will have to be sold in less attractive packaging. Other measures seek to better combat illicit products and regulate online tobacco sales. EU countries have two years to incorporate the new rules into their national laws. The tobacco reforms had proven controversial and were the focus of intense lobbying by the tobacco industry. Critics argued that the reforms would limit consumer choice, fuel the illegal trade in cigarettes, cut government revenues and cause job losses. In 2012, 28 per cent of the EU's 500 million citizens were believed to be smokers. Some 700,000 Europeans are estimated to die of tobacco-related diseases every year. Copyright dpa
