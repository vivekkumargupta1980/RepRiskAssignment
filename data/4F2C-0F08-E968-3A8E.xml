(AP) - A broker who says he gave $36,000 to Arkansas' former treasurer to help her during a rough patch in her life says he received more than $2 million in commissions for business he did for the state.
Under questioning by government lawyers in Martha Shoffner's corruption trial Monday, bond dealer Steele Stephens acknowledged he benefited by giving her money. He eventually received about twice as much state business as any other broker. As he wrapped up his testimony for the prosecution, he said he received about $2.5 million in commissions over the four years he was making payments to Shoffner.
Defense attorney Chuck Banks was to begin questioning Stephens later Monday morning.
Shoffner faces 14 bribery and extortion counts and has pleaded not guilty. She resigned last year.
