The fatal accident happened on Monday night around 23:00 hours at KDMP number one shaft.
KCM public relations and communications manager Shapi Shachinda named the deceased as Kafukanya Ngosa, 30, a drill rig operator.
Mr Sachinda said in a statement that Mr Ngosa was an employee of one of KCM's contractors, CMC Bomar.
He said Mr Ngosa died of injuries sustained after he was hit by the boom he was operating underground.
"Operations at the scene of the accident have been suspended to pave the way for both internal investigations and by the Mines Safety Department," he said.
Mr Shachinda said it was not the entire KDMP number one shaft that had been closed but that only operations on the section where the accident occurred had been suspended.
In January this year, seven miners were injured, with one in a critical condition, in an underground accident when a cage tripped.
Government moved in by suspending normal hoisting of copper ore at KDMP as preliminary investigations revealed high levels of negligence by KCM.
Copperbelt Police chief Joyce Kasosa also confirmed the accident.
Ms Kasosa said Mr Ngosa of House Number Q3, Chikosa Township in Chililabombwe was hit by the boom he was operating at level number 2900 Shaft number 1, resulting in his death.
