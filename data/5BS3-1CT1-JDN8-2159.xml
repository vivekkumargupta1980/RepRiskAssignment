CHINA'S Alibaba, the largest e-commerce business in the world, announced yesterday it would float on the American stock market in what could be the biggest initial public share offering of all time.
Analysts reckon that Alibaba could seek to raise up to $15bn through the share sale in a move which could value it at between $150bn and $200bn.
Details of the float may come as early as April.
At the top end, that would make Alibaba the world's second most valuable internet company after Google, which is valued at $394bn. Amazon and Facebook both have stock market values of $172bn.
Alibaba was founded by Jack Ma and 17 friends in 1999, when it offered just 22 items on its website. It has grown to dominate Chinese e-commerce and Mr Ma's wealth is estimated at $11.4bn. The firm employs more than 20,000. - INM
IT'S JUST over two weeks until the financial regulator, the British Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), takes over the regulation of payday lenders and the consumer credit sector, from the Office of Fair Trading.
Payday lenders make up a fraction of the sector, but they've attracted the most headlines and condemnation from consumer groups, so it's what the FCA will do about curbing the industry's excesses that's attracting the most interest.
The FCA will start regulating payday lenders from April 1 and says ominously that companies should "feel the difference" from day one. This week it announced an in-depth review into how payday lenders deal with arrears and defaults. - INM
