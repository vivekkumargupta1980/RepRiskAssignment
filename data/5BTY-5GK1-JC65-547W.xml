(AP) - North Carolina regulators say Duke Energy has repaired a crack in a dam at a coal ash pit near the Cape Fear River.
The state Department of Environment and Natural Resources said Monday that Duke had finished the work.
The agency last week approved Duke's plan to repair a large crack that had opened in an earthen dam that holds back millions of tons of coal ash.
Duke says no water was flowing through the dam.
The structure is at the Cape Fear River plant, where North Carolina regulators said Duke illegally pumped 61 million gallons of contaminated water from a coal ash pit.
Cape Fear is rated by the Environmental Protection Agency as a high-hazard dam where a spill could cause catastrophic damage to nearby homes and threaten lives.
