Michael and Diane Hockin claim the property empire they had built over 30 years was snatched from them when the bank's Global Restructuring Group put it into administration in 2012. Since then their London and Westcountry Estates - which converted redundant factories into premises for over 300 small business clients - has been sold off by administrator EY.
Legal claims by companies in administration are often taken up by the administrators, but in this case EY opted not to do so and vigorously contested signing the rights to sue RBS to the Hockins, even though Mrs Hockin remains a creditor. A court has now ruled she should be allowed to press ahead, Mr Hockin told i: "It's been two years and they've fought us every inch of the way. I'm pleased with the result but we're only halfway there. We are now lodging a claim against the swap and we'll be looking at the administration, which we believe was flawed."
While smaller businesses missold swaps can sign up to a review under the auspices of the Financial Conduct Authority, those deemed to be too big have to fight on alone. Alice Loveday, managing partner at Berg, the law firm that represented the Hockins, said: "They have lost the business they took 30 years building up. It was making £1m when put into admin."
EY said: "The administrators respectfully acknowledge the order and will act in accordance with the court's judgement."
An RBS spokesperson said: "The Hockins have previously raised issues concerning their swap transactions, which the bank has investigated and responded to in full. We have not found any evidence of wrongdoing by the bank."
Regulators are looking at GRG after Lawrence Tomlinson alleged it had tipped viable firms into bankruptcy in a report for the Government.
