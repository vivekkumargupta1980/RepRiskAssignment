Council must now table any forensic reports it has kept under wraps within the coming months. At least two completed forensic investigations that never saw the light of day will come into play. The first is an Ernst & Young forensic report into the metro's R2-billion Make-a-Difference (MAD) campaign. The report implicates various councillors and officials and although being referred to a council committee, has been swept under the carpet. The second concerns a R17-million black refuse bag contract. A forensic report by MMB Consultants, completed early last year, has been collecting dust in the office of executive mayor Zukiswa Ncitha. A circular from national Treasury to all municipalities warned that grant funding would be withheld if forensic reports are not dealt with. "Councils are again reminded of their responsibility to discuss the reports in council and to implement a fair procedure in dealing with the findings. "This would in all probability require action against councillors and/or officials. "If it is found that a municipality commissioned a forensic audit and that the subsequent report did not serve before the municipal council, national treasury will invoke Section 216 (2) of the Constitution against than municipality and stop all grant transfers." Treasury spokesman Jabulani Sikhakhane yesterday confirmed that affected municipalities are set to lose all their conditional grants. "This will be done on a case by case basis. Affected municipalities will have to provide evidence that they have implemented the recommendations arising out of such an investigation," Sikhakhane said. Ratepayers' groups said the millions BCM is at risk of losing could be spent on upgrading roads, tackling illegal electricity connectors, upgrading the sewerage system and upgrading public areas. If the metro loses out it will hit residents hardest. Metro spokesman Keith Ngesi said in the financial year that ends in three months time, BCM received more than R659-million in Treasury grants. For 2014-15 they expect R706-million. Ngesi said the grants were for roads upgrades, sanitation, electricity and housing. He would not comment on the failure to act on the graft reports. Council speaker Luleka Simon-Ndzele and Ncitha yesterday could not be reached for comment. Border-Kei Chamber of Business chairman Les Holbrook described it as a sad state of affairs, citing the unauthorised increase of councillors' salaries. "We all know where the metro is failing and the Minister of Finance has been very clear on the issue of finance and how he expects this money to be used," Holbrook said. "But it's very sad that things have come to this ... really quite disappointing." Local government MEC Mlibo Qoboshiyane yesterday said he agreed with Treasury's approach. "It is not an empty threat, and if not taken seriously millions will be lost by councils," Qoboshiyane said. He said all forensic investigations are supposed to be commissioned and tabled in council. The MEC said it does not necessarily have to be punitive, but should raise matters of inefficiency, maladministration and financial mismanagement. "People in public offices need to understand that these investigations are not meant to pursue individuals, but to correct what has been identified as wasteful, irregular or unlawful." DA councillor Lance Weyer this week submitted a motion to Simon-Ndzele's office, requesting that council table the graft reports in the next council meeting or face losing the much needed grants. Gonubie Ratepayers' Association chairman Andre Swart said withholding the grant might be a good thing as it could be a wake-up call. "Only 35% of this year's annual budget was used towards the city's infrastructure. Then they want to go to a conference in Port Alfred to decide how to spend the rest." Quigney Ratepayers Association chairman Rudy du Toit said he could not comment on the circular, but a portion of the money could be better spent upgrading Quigney as it was a tourist hotspot. "And yet Quigney is faced with issues of messed up roads, pavements and refuse collection problems. The area really needs to be upgraded in order to keep the tourists coming back. "The way the area looks now paints a terrible picture of the city." Berlin Residents Association chairman Khaya Witbooi said there were stringent rules forcing council to comply with regulations. "Their failure to be compliant means that it won't hit them but it will hit the people on the ground very hard. "If people are ignorant about what they are supposed to be doing, it means they care less about their own people," Witbooi said. He added that the grants could assist in eradicating the bucket system in the Berlin area, improving road infrastructure and maintaining "run down" municipal buildings. - Additional reporting by Zisanda Nkonkobe BURIED: BCM mayor Zukisa Faku casts the first sod to launch the controversial Make-A-Difference (MAD) campaign in 2010 Picture: FILE IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS: A cutout showing a few of the tough-talking paragraphs in the circular municipalities received from Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan
