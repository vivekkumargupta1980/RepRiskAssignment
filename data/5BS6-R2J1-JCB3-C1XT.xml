The low size of the fines and the number of administrative proceedings that the UOHS leads is surprising, Jitka Linhartova, a specialist in economic competition law of law office Schoenherr, told CTK today.
"The UOHS suffers either from a lack of human resources or a lack of motivation to sanction anti-competitive behaviour," she said.
The UOHS has a sufficient number of complaints, Linhartova added. According to UOHS statistics, the antitrust office received 122 complaints about cartel agreements and 124 complaints about abuse of dominant position on market last year.
The size of the fines depends on the individual cases that the UOHS closes in the given year. It did not close any bigger cartel case last year.
A major part of the imposed fines concerns German company REWE Zentralfinanz eG which operates, for example, Billa stores. The company failed to keep its pledges from 2008 by which the UOHS conditioned its merger with company Plus Discount. It was fined Kc23.9m for it.
The UOHS issued only two decisions concerning cartel agreements last year. It stopped, for example, proceedings with fuel distributors. Companies like OMV, Benzina and Shell came away without a fine.
The UOHS closed no case of alleged abuse of dominant market position. It wants to close bigger cases this year, UOHS chairman Petr Rafaj told CTK.
As regards the dominant position, the UOHS opened one new case. It concerns company Chaps which holds a monopoly position in train and bus schedules. It also launched four new proceedings for banned agreements.
The fines for economic competition for last year are some Kc15m lower than the fines concerning public procurement. The ratio used to be reverse in the past.
The highest sanction for last year also concerns public orders. The UOHS imposed a Kc25m fine on national rail operator Ceske drahy for faults in a tender for the purchase of trains Railjet. <p />
