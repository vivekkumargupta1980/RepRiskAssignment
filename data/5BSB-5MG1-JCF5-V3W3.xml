Virginia Passes "Patent Troll" Legislation
Virginia AG Mark Herring crafted "patent troll" legislation that was recently passed by the state General Assembly.Senate Bill 150, patroned by Senator Richard Stuart, and House Bill 375, sponsored by Delegate Israel O'Quinn, prohibit any person from making a bad faith assertion of patent infringement. Under the legislation, the AG is empowered to accept assurances of voluntary compliance and seek injunctive relief. The AG is also authorized to issue civil investigative demands."I've signed on to efforts to fight patent trolling because far too many of our businesses, especially small business, are being forced to spend huge sums of money defending themselves against these frivolous claims," stated AG Herring.This legislation is part of a growing trend: as recently reported on our blog, Oregon became the second state, behind Vermont, to enact "patent troll" legislation and Nebraska was considering similar legislation.

State AGs in the News
National Association of Attorneys General Sends Letter to West Virginia Legislative Leaders Regarding Bill Potentially Limiting Attorney General Powers
The National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) sent a letter signed by 36 AGs to the West Virginia legislative leadership expressing concern about House Bill 4490, currently under consideration, which would allegedly impose unprecedented, strict new standards on the West Virginia Attorney General.The letter focuses on a section of the bill that requires an attorney general to withdraw from any matter in which the office holder or member of his or her immediate family received economic compensation. NAAG states, "We are not aware of any statute that imposes such a broadly sweeping prohibition on an attorney general's office- at the state or federal levels."The letter also expresses concern that the bill would prohibit the entire AG's office from ever representing a state agency, official, or political subdivision if the attorney general asserts any legal position that is contrary to the legal opinion ever taken by a state agency, official, or political subdivision of the AG's office.Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Corey Palumbo states that there is little interest in his committee to hear the bill and that the bill is "close to dead."
Five States Join Lawsuit Challenging California Farming Legislation
Alabama AG Luther Strange, Kentucky AG Jack Conway, Nebraska AG Jon Bruning, Oklahoma AG Scott Pruitt, and Iowa Governor Terry Branstad joined a lawsuit filed by Missouri AG Chris Koster last month in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. The lawsuit alleged that a California farming law violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution and infringes on the state's sovereignty.As we previously reported, California legislation (AB 1437) requires all egg producers selling in California to comply with Proposition 2, a California voter-approved ballot initiative. Proposition 2 requires enclosures to provide "sufficient room" for egg-laying hens.Plaintiff AGs believe that this lawsuit addresses the question of whether elected officials in one state may regulate another state's citizens. A spokesperson for California AG Kamala Harris stated that if the lawsuit is successful, "it will limit the ability of voters in any state to enact laws they deem in their best interest."
New York Attorney General Partners with Facebook to Curb Illegal Online Gun Sales

Washington Attorney General's Open Government Bill Passed by Legislature
