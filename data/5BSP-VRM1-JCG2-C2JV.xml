PD Ports Services is preparing to apply for permission from North Lincolnshire Council to store the fertiliser on its Keadby site.
But local residents - of whom more than 90 per cent signed a petition opposing the plans - are concerned over the substance's explosive potential, ability to pollute the water supply if flooded, and the additional traffic coming through the village.
Representatives from the company met with residents at the St Oswald village hall last week.
Some of the protesters said they appreciated the firm's attempts to meet with them, but even a one-in-a-billion chance of explosion was too high for the village to risk.
A spokesman for PD Ports said: "At the moment we're at the start of the process.
"If by the end, 98 per cent of the village is still opposed to us, then morally we'd have to look very hard at our application."
Also included in PD Ports' representation was the possibility of the company investing in local infrastructure and amenities as part of the application.
