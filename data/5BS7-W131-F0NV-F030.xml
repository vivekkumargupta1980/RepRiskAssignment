Attorney General Joseph A. Foster and Commissioner Thomas S. Burack of the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services announced the settlement agreement yesterday, approved by a Merrimack County Superior Court judge.
Omnicare, based in Ohio, is a pharmaceutical provider and return business, according to the agreement. It operates long-term care mail order pharmacies. The majority of its clients are nursing homes, jails, assisted living facilities.
The state charged Omnicare did not identify some pharmaceutical waste as hazardouse and shipped that waste to facilities that weren't authorized to accept them.
Many pharmaceuticals are listed as hazardous waste and must be treated as uch in order to protect people and the environment.
The penalty of $298,100 will be paid to the state's Hazardous Waste Cleanup Fund.
The agreement also states Omnicare must remain in compliance with state and federal laws relating to its facility.
The violations came to light during a DES inspection in October 2011.
Omnicare corrected the problems and cooperated throughout the investigation, according to Foster's announcement.
