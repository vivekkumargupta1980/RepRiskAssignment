Mills, 30, was the founder and chief executive officer of Motionloft Inc., which makes motion sensors for retail stores to track pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Company shareholders fired him in December after three years as CEO.
Federal prosecutors charged Mills last month with defrauding a friend out of $210,000, a sum the man invested after Mills told him Cisco had agreed to buy Motionloft for $760 million. A grand jury indictment Thursday accused Mills of defrauding that investor and four others, all San Francisco-area residents, out of more than $500,000 last year with the same bogus claim of a Cisco buyout.
Mills "spent most of the money to fund a lavish lifestyle including private jet trips to luxurious vacation destinations, expensive entertainments, and ... payments to other victims," totaling $176,000, to ease their suspicions, the indictment said.
It said Mills told one victim that her share of the profit would be $10 million and that she should quit her job.
After eight days in custody, Mills was released on a $75,000 bond Feb. 27 to a halfway house, which he is allowed to leave only for medical appointments or to meet with his lawyer. He was arraigned in court Friday on two counts of wire fraud and four counts of money laundering but did not enter a plea.
Motionloft's chief investor, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, says he recapitalized the company in December to keep it from closing and brought in a new CEO.
