The company - which operated at the Kisbey site as Eagle Well Servicing - received fines and surcharges totalling $18,200 after guilty pleas were entered to two Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) charges related to the fact a guy line wasn't attached and that inaccurate entries were made in a tour book stating the guy line had been attached when it wasn't.
Neither of those actions or inactions were found to have caused the fatal accident.
Guy Ouellette, a 39-yearold rig manager for Eagle Well Servicing, fell to his death when an oil service rig unexpectedly collapsed on Dec. 14, 2009.
Emergency crews had been called to the scene, at about 2:30 p.m. on that date.
At the time, RCMP reported the Estevan man was up on the rig when it suddenly toppled over. Four other workers on the site weren't injured.
Ouellette was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival.
The portable oil service rig was being used at the time to pull casings from the oil well.
