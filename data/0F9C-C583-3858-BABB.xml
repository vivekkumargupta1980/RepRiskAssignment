2. China, U.S. should expand common interests: Premier LiChina and the United States should expand common interests while respecting each other’s core interests and major concerns and properly managing differences to further the level of bilateral relationship, Premier Li Keqiang said here Thursday.The common interests between China and the United States far outweigh their differences, Li told a press conference after the close of the annual national legislative session.“There is much more that we can do to further unleash the potential of Sino-U.S. cooperation. We need to make the most of our complementarities,” said Li.
3. Premier Li calls for new progress in mainland-Taiwan tiesPremier Li Keqiang on Thursday called for new progress in relations between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan.At a press conference following the conclusion of the annual parliamentary session, Li said people-to-people exchanges and business cooperation are important components of ties across the Taiwan Strait.“I hope to see even greater, new progress in cross-Strait ties this year,” Li said.Li said a record 8 million visits were recorded between the mainland and Taiwan last year, adding that he wished such good momentum could be kept in the future.He also hoped that follow-up talks on implementing the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), a wide-ranging cross-Strait economic pact signed in 2010, could bear fruit earlier, “so that greater benefits can be delivered to people and businesses of both sides.”Li noted that press from both the mainland and Taiwan selected the Chinese character “jin” – or “progress” in English – as their respective word of the year.“This (selection) shows the trend of peaceful development of cross-Strait ties and represents the common wish of people on both sides,” Li said.
4. Chinese premier vows “zero-tolerance” to corruptionChina will show “zero-tolerance” to corrupt officials no matter “how senior his position is,” Premier Li Keqiang said at a press conference Thursday after the annual parliamentary session concluded.“China is a country under rule of law. No matter who he is, and how senior his position is, if he violates Party discipline and the law of the country, he will be punished to the full extent, because everybody is equal before the law,” Li said.“Corruption is a natural enemy of the people’s government,” Li said. “We must put the exercise of power and the use of public money under institutional checks.”Li said the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese government are firm in will and determination to fight corruption, and “that is our consistent position.”Since its 18th National Congress, the CPC has been steadfast in combating corruption and holding corrupt officials accountable, Li said, adding that visible progress has been made in this regard and the Party and the government will carry forward this campaign with perseverance.Li said that the government will continue to streamline administration and delegate government powers.The government will step up its efforts for the release of “a list of powers” and define a clear boundary for the exercise of power to ensure that power is not abused, he said.The government will also carry out comprehensive audit in those areas which are of high concern to the public, such as the revenues on the transfer of land use rights and transfer of mining rights, according to Li.“We will take institutional steps to ensure… corruption will have nowhere to hide,” Li said.
5. Chinese premier says GDP target flexible, stresses employmentChinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said there is a level of flexibility for the government’s growth target at around 7.5 percent this year, stressing rather the importance of creating enough jobs.“We are not preoccupied with GDP growth. The growth that we want is one that brings real benefits to the people, helps raise the quality and efficiency of economic development, and contributes to energy conservation and environment protection,” Li stressed when asked on the lowest growth rate that the government can live with.Li’s elaboration came after the government announced last week that the country will target an unchanged growth of around 7.5 percent in 2014.It also vowed to keep inflation at around 3.5 percent and create 10 million more urban jobs to ensure the registered urban unemployment rate does not rise above 4.6 percent.At the conference, Li underscored the importance of a proper growth to deliver enough urban jobs while leaving room for the six to seven million migrant workers to seek employment in cities.China’s economy grew 7.7 percent last year, well above the government goal, but a set of data that pointed to softening manufacturing activity in recent months has renewed concerns on the growth outlook of the world’s second largest economy.In response to the concerns, Li emphasized that China’s economy has “tremendous potential and resilience”, and the country has the ability and conditions to keep its economic operation within a proper range.The premier noted a spate of complex challenges for this year, including enhancing the quality and efficiency of economic development, tackling pollution and saving energy.“So we need to strike a proper balance amidst all these goals and objectives. This is not going to be easy,” Li acknowledged.“We need to face up to the difficulties and challenges and make the most of the favorable conditions. This holds the secret of our success,” he said, citing a Chinese proverb that “only a sharpened axe can cut through firewood.”Although China’s 7.5 percent growth target is the same as previous years, its importance is fading as many believe the government will no longer view the figure as the necessary minimum as it usually did in the past.Senior leaders and officials have on various occasions backed up the macro-economic control strategy featuring the idea of “a proper range,” — a lower limit to ensure steady growth and job creation and an upper limit to avert inflation, which was first proposed by Li in July.Finance minister Lou Jiwei joined the chorus last Thursday, calling for more comprehensive understanding on the country’s growth target instead of merely fixating on the 7.5-percent figure.GDP growth, inflation and employment are all key factors that should be taken into consideration when assessing economic conditions, Lou told a press conference, adding that a growth of 7.3 percent or 7.2 percent can still be counted within that range.
6. China to better handle relations between government, market: Premier LiPremier Li Keqiang said Thursday that the Chinese government will better handle the relationship between the government and the market, so as to add new impetus to the Chinese economy and boost the creativity and dynamism from all sides.Last year, the Chinese central government took streamlining administration and delegating power to lower-level governments as the top priority on the reform agenda, Li told a press conference after the conclusion of the annual legislative session.He said that the central government has abolished or delegated to lower-level governments 416 items previously subject to the review and approval of the State Council, or China’s cabinet.“This has sent out a very strong signal that we need to loosen strait-jacket over businesses and truly enable the market to play its role,” Li said.The number of newly registered businesses increased by 27.6 percent last year, among which newly registered privately-held businesses increased by 30 percent. This was the highest in over a decade, the premier revealed.“This shows that streamlining administration and delegating power is a powerful tool in energizing the market and stimulating social creativity,” he said.It was decided at the third plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China that the market will play a decisive role in allocating resources and government should play its role. “So streamlining administration and delegating power is a very important starting point,” Li said.He emphasized that the market economy is one based on the rule of law. “We need to ensure that market energies can do anything that is not prohibited by the law, and government departments must not do anything unless it is mandated by the law.”He also said that delegating power does not mean the government will stay out of everything, and that he hopes to combine both delegating power and tightened oversight.“The government in this way will have extra energy to focus its attention on pursuing creative and better macro-control,” he said.Li said he is aware that in the course of delegating power, there have been such practices as midway obstruction or delegating power getting stuck in the last mile.But he added: “How can an arrow shot be turned back? We’re most determined to see the reform through.”
7. China able to keep economic operation in proper range: PremierPremier Li Keqiang said Thursday that Chinese economy has “tremendous potential and resilience” and the country has the ability and conditions to keep its economic operation in a proper range.
8. China’s debt risk within control: PremierChina has attached high attention on government debt and risks in this area are generally within control, Premier Li Keqiang said at a press conference on Thursday.Citing an official audit of government debts last year, Li said the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio is still below the internationally recognized warning line.China’s mounting government debt is considered as a latent danger to financial stability, and the country has started to take steps to address the issue.After two months of nationwide audits, the National Audit Office disclosed that governments at various levels were liable for a total direct debt of 20.7 trillion yuan (3.4 trillion U.S. dollars) at the end of June, up 8.6 percent, or 1.63 trillion yuan, since the end of 2012.While the level is within control, Li cautioned that the problem should not be overlooked, promising to take further regulatory steps, including putting the debt under budgetary management, to strengthen oversight.In China, local governments are not legally allowed to borrow funds on their own. The fiscal funds they receive from the central government and other sources of revenue, such as taxes, cannot meet their funding needs either, forcing them to use back-door approaches for funding that involves state-owned firms and local government financing vehicles.“We will keep the front open and block side doors,” Li stressed at the press conference following the conclusion of the annual legislative session.His comments on Thursday followed reform plans unveiled in his government work report last week to overhaul the current financing scheme for local governments.“We will establish a standard financing mechanism for local governments to issue bonds and place local government debt under budgetary management,” said the government report delivered by Li at the opening of the annual session of the National People’s Congress.To guard against and defuse debt risks, China will also implement a comprehensive government financial reporting system, according to the report.The premier also said Thursday that authorities has set a timetable for implementing the Basel III accord in tightening regulative measures over shadow banking.Regarding the defaults of financial products, Li said avoiding a few individual cases would be difficult, but efforts must be taken to make sure regional and systemic financial risks do not occur.
9. Timetable set for implementing Basel III: Chinese premierChinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday that the authorities had set a timetable for implementing the Basel III accord in tightening regulative measures over shadow banking.“Concerning financial risks such as shadow banking, we are tightening regulation and have set a timetable for implementing the regulative measures under the Basel III accord,” Li said.He made the remarks at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China’s annual legislative session.As to whether China has set too high capital adequacy ratios for banks, Li said, “We are a developing country, but this is what we have to do, and we cannot let today’s stepping stone become tomorrow’s stumbling stone.”“It is indeed difficult to avoid a few individual cases, and we must tighten monitoring and deal with the problems timely to make sure regional and systemic financial risks do not occur,” he added.
10. Timetable set to regulate shadow banking: PremierChina has set a timetable concerning the regulation over shadow banking, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday.
11. Fiscal, tax, financial reforms high on agenda: Chinese premierChinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday that fiscal, tax and financial reforms had been set as a priority on the country’s overall reform agenda in 2014.“In the course of comprehensively deepening reform, we certainly need to be focused on key reforms and initiatives and we need to see breakthroughs in key areas,” Li said.“We will press ahead with fiscal, tax and financial reforms as our priorities this year,” said the premier at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China’s annual legislative session.The authorities will continue to streamline administration and delegate power to ensure that the market fully play its role in an effective and well-regulated manner, he said.The premier also listed reforms in other areas, including taking new steps to ease the tax burden of micro-and-small businesses, deepening reforms of state-owned enterprises, and vigorously developing mixed-ownership economy.Market access would also be eased, especially in the service sectors, such as healthcare, old-age support and financial services, so as to bring greater competition in the market, he said.“The ultimate goal of all the reforms is to fully energize the market and the creativity of society,” said the premier.He warned that, “In the course of reforms, the vested interests will be shaken and some people’s cheese will be moved.”However, the country would “carry out the reforms without hesitation” in order to further release the dividends of reform and bring greater benefits to the people, he added.Since last year, the State Council had convened 40 executive meetings, 30 of which were directly related to reform topics, according to the premier.
12. Premier Li stresses confidence in Hong Kong’s competitive edge, prosperityChinese Premier Li Keqiang expressed his confidence Thursday in Hong Kong’s competitive edge and ability to maintain prosperity.The central government’s policy toward Hong Kong and Macao is consistent and clear-cut, said Li at a press conference after the annual parliamentary session ended.“We will continue to support Hong Kong in maintaining and elevating its status as an international financial, trading and shipping center,” he said.The mainland’s reform and economic upgrading will open tremendous chances to Hong Kong, Li said.The mainland is opening up its service sector, in which Hong Kong has a strong leading edge, he said, citing an old Chinese saying that a pavilion that is close to the pond will get the moonlight first.“With Hong Kong people’s enterprising spirit, I have confidence that Hong Kong will keep its competitive edge and maintain prosperity amid future competition,” he said.
13. China to continue search for missing plane as long as there is glimmer of hope: PremierChina will not give up its efforts in searching for a missing Malaysia Airlines flight with 154 Chinese aboard “as long as there is a glimmer of hope,” Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday.Li made the remarks at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China’s annual legislative session.“We will not give up any suspected clue that is being found,” he said. “We are also looking very closely at all suspected clues showing on satellite images.”His remarks came after a Chinese satellite found three floating objects at a suspected site of the missing plane.The satellite images, which are being analyzed, showed that the objects on the South China Sea were spreading across an area with a radius of 20 kilometers.Li said that the Chinese government has asked all relevant parties in the ongoing massive international search to enhance coordination to investigate the cause and to locate the missing plane as soon as possible.The Chinese government has activated a comprehensive contingency response and search operation, according to the premier.Currently there are eight Chinese vessels in the related waters and another one is on its way towards the respected waters, he said, adding that 10 satellites are now being used to provide information and technological support.“The Chinese government and Chinese people are all deeply concerned about safety of the plane,” he said. “We are all eagerly awaiting news about the plane, even a slightest piece of good news.”Flight MH370 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members vanished on March 8 on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing after losing contact with air traffic control in waters between Malaysia and Vietnam.The international search for the missing flight, which has so far involved at least 40 ships and nearly 40 aircraft from 12 countries, entered its sixth day Thursday, but the whereabouts of the Boeing 777-200 remains unknown.Li also said the incident will not affect China’s opening-up policy, in response to a question raised by a journalist.
