Officials with Kitchenerbased Hybrid Turkeys, one of only two primary turkeybreeding companies in the world, acknowledged that the euthanasia methods depicted in the video violated the company's animal-welfare policies. They described the behaviour of its employees as "isolated."
The video made public Friday by Mercy for Animals Canada has prompted investigations by the Ontario Provincial Police and the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Similar undercover operations conducted by the activist group's counterparts at turkey farms owned by Butterball in the United States have resulted in multiple criminal convictions for animal cruelty.
Twyla François, Mercy's director of investigations, said the video was shot while an activist was undercover as an egg collector for eight weeks at a farm in Bright, Ont., an hour west of Hamilton, one of 20 operated by Hybrid Turkeys. The hidden-camera footage shows a worker using a rod and a shovel to bash the head of a bird.
At various times, the video shows workers kicking or throwing birds, and also shows birds with open and bloody wounds or with rotting eyes.
François said sick or injured birds either need to be treated immediately or euthanized by qualified veterinarians.
All future euthanizing of birds by Hybrid Turkeys should be live-streamed to the Internet to ensure it's done humanely, she said.
The advocacy group also called for the company to stop breeding turkeys to grow so fast and large that they become "crippled under their own weight."
David Libertini, Hybrid Turkey's managing director, said the company has "zero tolerance for animal abuse" and has hired an outside investigator to review "the incident," as well as the company's animal-welfare program and training practices.
Helen Wojcinski, the company's science and sustainability manager, said the company will install video cameras to monitor the euthanizing of all its turkeys and will assign a veterinarian to review the tapes. It is also partnering with the University of Guelph to research the most effective and humane forms of euthanasia.
Hybrid Turkeys is a division of Netherlands-based Hendrix Genetics, which specializes in the breeding of turkeys, pigs and aquaculture.
