The case related to NSEL causing a Rs 120-crore loss to state-run PEC's investments.
CBI has named Shah, former NSEL chief executive Anjani Sinha, PEC executives, including chief general manager Rajiv Chaturvedi and a number of other companies as accused in the case of cheating, forgery and corruption, sources said.
CBI director Ranjit Sinha said while the focus of investigations by Mumbai Police's Economic Offences Wing was on investors' complaints, the agency is looking into the loss caused to PEC, a public sector undertaking, as a result of the conspiracy. CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad said the case was registered on the allegation that the accused persons between 2007 and 2013 were party to a criminal conspiracy to cheat PEC "...in the matter of floating accommodative and fraudulent paired contracts for trading of agro commodities on the platform of Mumbai-based company without actually undertaking any genuine trade".
After registering the case, a CBI team carried out searches at 15 locations. Sources also said rumours of a major cash haul from a former executive of NSEL, whose premises were searched, were incorrect. "Certain officials of PEC abused their official position as public servants and allegedly invested in purchase of agro commodities of PEC on the platform of the Mumbai-based company (NSEL) without ensuring any physical delivery of the commodities and without obtaining documents of title," Prasad said.
CBI sources said the probe so far showed that NSEL claimed that it had designated warehouses where commodities could be stored and it would issue warehouse certificates. Sources said these certificates were issued even though no products were physically brought to the warehouses. These warehouse receipts are used to sell commodity to the buyer against receipt of funds and under a separate contract, the investor would sell the purchased commodity to the second-tier investor.
In the absence of any designated warehouses or any backup in terms of actual commodity stock there was nothing that could be liquidated as recovery against their investments, the preliminary probe shows. About Rs 343 crore of state-owned trading firms MMTC and PEC is stuck with the crisis-ridden NSEL which has to settle nearly Rs 5,500 crore with 148 entities including several brokerage. NSEL, promoted by Jignesh Shah-headed Financial Technologies India (FTIL), was hit by crisis after it suspended trade on July 31 following a government directive, raising concerns about possible default of Rs 5,600 crore due to about 13,000 investors, including 7,000 small ones.
