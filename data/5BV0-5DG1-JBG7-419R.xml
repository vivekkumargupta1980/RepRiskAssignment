The payments, which vary depending on how many e-books consumers bought from April 1, 2010, to May 21, 2012, stem from an antitrust lawsuit filed in April 2012 that accused the publishers of conspiring to raise prices to undermine Amazon's grip on the e-book business.
Customers received $3.17 for every New York Times best-seller purchased during this time, and 73 cents for other books.
Minnesota residents got slightly more because their attorney general negotiated a separate deal.
Those publishers -- Macmillan, Penguin, Hachette, HarperCollins, and Simon & Schuster -- provided the money, which is being handed out by Amazon and other e-book sellers, including Barnes & Noble, Kobo and Apple.
Settlement details can be found at ebooksagsettlements.com.
Apple, which chose not to settle the case, was ordered last fall to modify its contracts with publishers and hire an outside monitor to make sure the company complies with antitrust laws.
A trial to determine damages that Apple may be required to pay is expected later this year.
