The Austin American-Statesman reports that a lawsuit filed in Travis County District Court against the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission charges the TABC with withholding documents seized in a raid of Twin Liquors' offices last April. The suit also claims the TABC is working to revoke the liquor licenses of some of the company's 20-plus stores in the Austin area.
The investigation allegedly is looking at links between Twin Liquors' management and Yassine Enterprises, family members of which are serving time in federal prison in connection with charges of drug trafficking, money laundering and assorted weapons offenses. Nine nightclubs operated by the Yassine family were raided and closed in March 2012.
TABC records show some liquor permit renewals for several Twin Liquors locations as either pending or expired.
Just after the Twin Liquors raid last year company officials with the company said they had no idea why the company was being investigated.
