Solicitors Madden and Finucane said a senior doctor and a patient at the accident and emergency department are taking the legal action against the West Belfast institution.
The law firm claimed evidence of "appalling standards of care and neglect of patients" had been disclosed to them. Solicitor Patrick Finucane said: "This action relates to negligence at the hospital and a systemic failure which has led to patients suffering avoidable harm and deprivation of their basic human rights."
He added they had evidence that would show that the environment in the RVH was "toxic for staff and patients".
Mr Finucane said: "The hospital has failed in its basic duty of care. Given the extent of the failures within this department, we consider that a full public inquiry is of urgent public importance."
The Belfast Health Trust which runs the RVH said they were waiting for correspondence from Madden and Finucane.
A spokesman added the trust will deal with any legal proceedings appropriately.
The source added: "At this time we are not in a position to comment further.
"The Trust is currently participating in an RQAI (Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority) review of emergency and unscheduled care."
