Sigmatek Inc., No. 14-1747 (N.D. Ill. complaint filed Mar. 12, 2014)</title><source>Insurance Law &amp; Litigation Week</source><author></author><text><![CDATA[U.S. Liability Insurance Co. (USLIC) filed a lawsuit alleging it does not owe coverage for an underlying case alleging a government contractor defrauded the U.S. Department of Defense.
According to the lawsuit, USLIC provided employment practices liability insurance to Sigmatek Inc., which had contracts with the U.S. government to provide gun mounts and tripods to agencies within the Department of Defense. The lawsuit alleges Sigmatek did not provide enough quality control and essentially committed fraud on the government by selling subpar products.
USLIC alleges that it does not owe coverage under the circumstances because the complaint alleging violations of the False Claims Act are not "claims" seeking to hold an insured responsible for a "wrongful act," as required under the policy.
Counsel for USLIC : Lawrence S. Gosewisch, David J. Altschuler, Adler Murphy & McQuillen L.L.P., 312-345-0700, Chicago.
