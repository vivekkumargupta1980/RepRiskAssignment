The Ukrainian police detained board chairman of the national gas company Naftogaz Ukrainy Yevhen Bakulin on Friday as part of an investigation into corruption in the gas industry, acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov has written on his Facebook page.
"The actions of the criminal group cost the Ukrainian state around $4 billion on just three counts being probed by police investigators. And that is far from being a full list of dodgy schemes and operations that have come under the scrutiny of our investigators," the acting interior minister said.
The inquiry "could lead to a discovery of colossal losses to the state and the involvement in them of famous personalities, including from the current political elite," Avakov said.
"I have decided to expand the team of investigators working in this area. I am warning politicians against meddling in the inquiry. I am warning that my response will be tough, including my public reaction to any attempts to put pressure on the investigators," the minister said.
The cynicism of theft in some of the probed schemes are glaring, Avakov said.
"This could only happen in an atmosphere of total permissiveness and connivance on the part of former top government, interior and prosecution officials. This inquiry is important not only for the sake of restoring justice and returning what was stolen. It is more important as a vaccination against corruption in the new government!" the interior minister said.
It was reported that Bakulin had led Naftogaz Ukrainy since March 2010. He led the company previously between March and December 2007.
Bakulin, born in 1956, spent more than 20 years working at Lysychansk Oil Refinery in Luhansk region. Between July 2001 and May 2003 he led Lysychansknaftoorgsyntez which operated the refinery. Between June 2003 and March 2005 and from September 2006 he led Ukrgazvydobuvannia.
Naftogaz of Ukraine includes the country's largest oil and gas producing companies and holds a monopoly for natural gas transit and storage in underground facilities and for crude oil transportation through Ukrainian pipelines.
