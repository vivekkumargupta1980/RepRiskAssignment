killed in their beds
CAIRO - Gunmen stormed an Egyptian army checkpoint outside Cairo early Saturday and killed six soldiers, including some still in their beds, officials said, in what amounted to an escalation by militants on military targets near the capital.
Just days earlier, masked men opened fire on a busload of military police inside city limits, another rare attack on soldiers this far from the restive Sinai Peninsula, where the army is fighting a counter-insurgency campaign.
Provincial security chief Maj. Gen. Mahmoud Yousri told state news agency MENA that the gunmen also planted explosive devices after Saturday's attack in Shubra al-Kheima, but bomb disposal experts managed to diffuse two and detonate another in a controlled explosion.
The military blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for the attack, calling the group "terrorists" and saying they had planted the additional bombs to target rescue workers rushing to the scene.
Armed Forces Spokesman Col. Ahmed Mohammed Ali said the soldiers, of a military police unit, were attacked just after morning prayers. The Health Ministry confirmed the death toll.
"These cowardly operations will only increase our determination to continue the war against terrorism," Ali said.
Amr Darrag, former head of the Foreign Relations Committee for the Brotherhood's political party, condemned the attack and denied responsibility.
