The EPA's ban was implemented in November of 2012, after BP pleaded guilty in federal court to 14 charges related to the spill. The charges included 11 counts of manslaughter for the workers who lost their lives in the initial explosion on the Macondo oil rig, one count of obstruction of Congress, and two misdemeanors under the Migratory Bird Treaty and Clean Water Acts.BP agreed to pay $4 billion over five years as part of the settlement, including $1.256 billion in criminal fines, $2.394 billion for the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and $350 million to the National Academy of Sciences. Despite the seriousness of the charges, not a single BP executive spent even a day in jail as part of the settlement.From the very beginning, the response of the Obama administration has been to shield BP as much as possible from the repercussions of the worst industrial accident in American history. As the Macondo rig leaked oil for months into the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in an oil sheen hundreds of miles wide and clearly visible from space, the government worked with the company to conceal the extent of the leak.Â© 2014 Global Data Point.
