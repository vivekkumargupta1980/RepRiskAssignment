The Federal Environment Department's assistant secretary Mary Wiley-Smith is the first witness to give evidence at the public hearing into whether the former Labor government failed to heed safety warnings before the deaths of four workers in 2009 and 2010.
Ms Wiley-Smith told the hearing she and a colleague were given two days to plan and cost the scheme, which aimed to insulate more than two million homes.
They were ordered not to discuss the scheme with colleagues or industry members, she said.
While they recommended that the program be implemented over five years, the government opted to attempt implementation in two, she added.
Federal cabinet documents relating to the home insulation scheme set up under the former Labor government have dominated the opening discussions at the royal commission hearings in Brisbane.
The Coalition Government has provided every cabinet document relating to the insulation scheme to the commission, including cabinet notebooks and letters between former prime minister Kevin Rudd and his then-environment minister Peter Garrett.
Cabinet documents are usually kept under wraps for up to 30 years.
Tom Howe QC, representing the Commonwealth, argued today that the documents should be suppressed, saying that there would be "no information barrier" to the material but that "ventilation" of it was another matter.
Commissioner Ian Hanger QC has requested an affidavit from the Commonwealth by Thursday, before he rules on the request.
The hearing heard that Mr Rudd, Mr Garrett, whose department managed the scheme, and former employment participation minister Mark Arbib would be called to give evidence.
The home insulation program was set up in 2009 by Mr Rudd and Mr Garrett to help ward off the effects of the global financial crisis by paying rebates to homeowners or installers of roof insulation.
But during the roll-out of the $2.5 billion scheme, four men died and hundreds of house fires broke out, many of them in ceilings where foil insulation had been incorrectly installed.
Mr Hanger says he will investigate whether the deaths of the insulation installers, in Queensland and New South Wales in 2009 and 2010, could have been prevented.
Former and current federal department chiefs and former ministerial advisers have also been named on a proposed witness list of 20 people for the first three weeks of what is expected to be five weeks of hearings.
Among them are now retired Environment Department head Robyn Kruk and former Commonwealth coordinator-general, now Infrastructure Department chief Mike Mrdak.
Another former Labor prime minister, Julia Gillard, has also been asked to provide documents, and it is believed other senior figures have been contacted by the commission, including current Opposition frontbencher Penny Wong.
Counsel Assisting Keith Wilson QC said more than 32,000 documents had been lodged, and 72 interviews conducted, including with two with unnamed former federal MPs.
Counsel Assisting the Commission said cabinet confidentiality issues would come up every day that needed "to be sorted out" and asked the commissioner to make a ruling on use of cabinet documents.
Focus on whether insulation scheme risks were given to Labor
The Coalition Government established the Royal Commission into the Home Insulation Program in December and charged it with finding out whether the former Labor government was given any advice, warnings or recommendations about the program.
The commission is set to investigate how advice, warnings and recommendations were identified, assessed and managed.
Labor leader Bill Shorten said his party supported any measures aimed at improving workplace safety, but pointed out that there had already been several inquiries into the issue.
"There's already been a fair bit of work done there," he said.
"The tragedy is that four young men died.
"When it comes to workplace safety, we don't need politics, and everyone should cooperate with improving workplace safety."
Lawyer Bill Potts is representing the family of Rueben Barnes, who was 16 when he was electrocuted at a home near Rockhampton in central Queensland in 2009.
"It is expected that the royal commission will hear evidence that both industry groups and the experts in this area raised at an early stage safety issues, both with the installation process and the training that was actually being given to the installers," he told AM.
"The question is when those warnings were made and why weren't they heeded."
A recent report by Queensland Coroner Michael Barnes into the deaths of three of the workers found the home insulation scheme was rolled out too quickly with inadequate safeguards.
That report prompted an apology from Mr Rudd to the families of the workers.
Mr Potts says the royal commission will have a broader scope to investigate the issue.
"What was not explored by the inquest was the upper level government findings and the decision making process and that's what the Royal Commission will focus on," he said.
