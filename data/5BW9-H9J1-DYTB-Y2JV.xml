"There were no facts or documents that provide proof of any payment to employees," Petrobras said in a statement.
The company added that an internal probe into the firm's controversial US$1.2bn purchase of the Pasadena oil refinery in Texas is expected to end next month.
Petrobras is alleged to have paid more than 10 times the market value for the facility from Belgian trader Transcor Astra Group SA in 2006.
