"Chris's addition underscores our commitment to expanding the firm's presence in key markets and enhancing its bench strength in core practice areas," said Proskauer Chairman Joseph M. Leccese. "The broad spectrum of Chris's antitrust and regulatory capabilities will be a great complement to our seasoned team in D.C."

His joining is an affirmation of our commitment to provide clients with comprehensive, world-class antitrust services. We welcome him to our team."

We are excited to have someone of Chris's caliber join Proskauer and look forward to working closely with him," said Litigation Department co-Chair Brendan J. O'Rourke.
