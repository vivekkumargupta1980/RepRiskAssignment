Duke Energy says in a letter to state environmental officials that it plans to move to a safer method of handling coal ash at its Asheville plant.
The utility also said it wants to move some of its leaky ash ponds, including one that coated 70 miles of the Dan River with toxic sludge.
But as far as what steps might be taken at the Asheville facility, the letter is unclear, said D.J. Gerken of the Southern Environmental Law Center.
"As far as can be read in the letter, the intent for the Asheville plant may be pretty positive," he said. "But there's so much ambiguity that we can't really tell.
"Most significantly, the letter commits to either using a dry storage method for ash at the Asheville plant, or better yet, retiring the coal-fired units at Asheville."
Duke says it will take at least two years to clean up the Dan River site, and sites near Asheville and Charlotte. State regulators say Duke's plans fall short of cleaning up nearly three dozen leaky coal ash dumps spread across the state.
After the Feb. 2 spill, Gov. Pat McCrory and regulators gave Duke a March 15 deadline to provide details of how the company would stop pollution at the ash pits.
Duke President Lynn Good sent Department of Environment and Natural Resources Secretary John Skvarla a letter with details.
But on Thursday, Skvarla called the plans inadequate.
