Fire Services Commissioner Craig Lapsley said with the fire declared safe, management of the mine would go back to operator GDF Suez.
"When an incident is declared safe it means fire authorities are confident it no longer poses any threat to people or communities," he said.
Tuesday was the last shift for fire services at the mine.
"The CFA will continue to support GDF Suez and the local CFA will be liaising closely with the mine owners and be on hand to help if needed," Mr Lapsley said.
The fire inside a "worked out" part of the mine ignited on February 9.
The fire sent smoke and fine coal ash over Morwell, population 14,000, for weeks, giving local residents poor air quality.
Many residents complained of headaches, sore throats and eyes, nausea and other concerns, which they blamed on the fire.
