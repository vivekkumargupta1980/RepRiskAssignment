The governor said he has received complaints from residents and environmentalists that Sukari Industries was allegedly emptying raw sewerage into River Kuja.
The river is the main source of water for people and livestock in Ndhiwa subcounty. Speaking at Minya Primary School grounds, Awiti gave the firm two weeks to correct the mess or face disciplinary action. "We are ready to work with Sukari Industries because it is the only industry in Homa Bay county but we will not allow them to pollute the environment," he said.
"They must follow the law. They must also safeguard and respect the rights of the people who are providing them with sugarcane." Awiti said the pollution of the river could be responsible for the disease break outs in the subcounty. He told the company's managers, who attended the meeting, to upgrade its weighing machines as residents had complained they are faulty.
Meanwhile, the governor asked the national government to control importation as imported sugar had flooded the market, forcing local millers to reduce cane prices. "This is our only industry and it will not survive if the imports are not controlled. The collapse of this mill will spell doom to our farmers," Awiti said.
