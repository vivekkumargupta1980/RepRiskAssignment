Malcolm Fyfield, aged 58, from Caerhenllys in Cwmllynfell, denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence.
MNS Mining Limited, which ran the Gleision Colliery, denies four charges of corporate manslaughter.
The jury of eight women and four men have now been sworn in to hear the case. They had been chosen at random from a pool of 70 during a selection process lasting two days.
During that process, the judge had asked them if they had any connection to any of the groups who would be involved in the trial, including the police, Mines Rescue Service, Coal Authority and Neath Port Talbot Council. They were also told the names of 90 witnesses expected to give evidence and were told the trial, at Swansea Crown Court, would last more than four months.
The Honourable Mr Justice Wyn Williams warned the jurors they were not allowed to research the case on their own and must come to their verdicts on the evidence they saw and heard during the trial.
"It would be facile of me to pretend if you went onto the internet or to a library, you wouldn't be able to find out a lot about this case," he said.
"Please put any such idea out of your head. It's completely prohibited from now on for you to make any of your own research."
He told the jury the prosecution case would open tomorrow.
The prosecution are represented by Gregg Taylor QC and Nuhu Gohir. Fyfield is represented by Elwen Evans QC and Owen Williams, the company is represented by Prashant Popat.
Philip Hill, aged 44, Charles Breslin, aged 62, David Powell, aged 50, and Garry Jenkins, aged 39 all died in the disaster in September 2011.
