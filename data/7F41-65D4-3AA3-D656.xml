Around 350 residents from Dhutum participated in the protest and blocked traffic for 5 hours, demanding the compensation for the family of Shrikant Thakur's, 32. Thakur was crushed by a trailer on the busy highway on Wednesday.
The villagers complained that as many as 10 people had lost their lives in road accidents in the area over the last few months.
A long queue of trailers was seen on the road during the protest. The protestors only withdrew the agitation after assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Shashikant Borate assured them that he will convene a meeting of transporters, government officials and villagers at his office over the incident. He assured the villagers that their demand for compensation would be looked into.
According to senior inspector, Rajendra Galande, "The victim worked at Sea Bird godown in Drongiri and was on his way to work on his motorcycle on Wednesday morning. A trailer coming from the right side of the road took a sudden turn near the IOTL company junction and hit his motorcycle."
Thakur came under the wheels of the trailer and died on the spot. Suvarna Patil, who was riding pillion on the bike, sustained serious injuries.
