The company has to give a 48 hour notice to state environmental regulators and parties involved in various lawsuits and bankruptcy proceedings.
The World War II-era chemical tank that spilled had two holes, just a few millimeters each, and subpar last-resort containment walls. Nothing exploded or engulfed in flames, the usual reasons chemical facilities are ordered to be destroyed.
T2 Laboratories Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla. had to be decommissioned after an explosion killed four people and hospitalized 32 in 2007. So did Formosa Plastics, an Illinois facility that blew up in 2004, killing four employees and seriously injuring two others.
Conversely, the colorless pollutant crude MCHM, combined with stripped PPH, was noticeable in Charleston only because of its chemical black licorice odor.
"There are certainly other instances where facilities that were heavily damaged were dismantled after major accidents," said Daniel Horowitz, Chemical Safety Board managing director. "What is perhaps unusual here is that the facility is largely intact, albeit with significant environmental concerns that will need remediation."
The company's neighbors can expect one more strong whiff of licorice when serious tank deconstruction starts, said Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Tom Aluise.
Millions of gallons of the company's chemicals are already gone, either sold off to competitors and suppliers or shipped to a coal facility in Pennsylvania. Freedom Industries' 51 employees are looking for new jobs, and the company says it won't be operational much longer after filing for bankruptcy Jan. 17.
U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., first publicly called for Freedom Industries to dismantle its Charleston location. The next day, the Department of Environmental Protection drafted the order, and Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin made it official on Jan. 24. Freedom Industries immediately opted to comply.
Even after the Freedom Industries tanks disappear, West Virginia Rivers Coalition Executive Director Angie Rosser said there is much left to learn. Changes to state law requiring more registrations and inspections will reveal the virtually unknown chemicals that threaten public water supplies, she said.
"It's only addressing one facility," Rosser said of the order to destroy the tanks. "We're going to learn a lot more in the weeks and months ahead about the tank farms that exist around the state."
