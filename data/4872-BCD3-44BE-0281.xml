Two weeks after Russian forces entered the peninsula en masse, Russia's stock market and economic data have started to signal trouble -- the start of what could become a lasting pullback by foreign investors. That would badly hurt Russia's efforts to modernize and diversify its economy.
At the United Nations and other international forums, the number of countries supporting Moscow on the issue has shrunk close to zero. Even China, which frequently sides with Russia on international issues, has turned sour.
Nor has Putin succeeded in splitting the Western coalition and stopping U.S.-led efforts to impose sanctions in retaliation for the seizure of Crimea. Instead, his bellicose strategy seems to have driven the alliance together while frightening countries on Russia's borders into closer cooperation with the U.S. and western Europe.
The clearest indication of how Putin's action may be backfiring came Thursday when German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had been the top advocate for a soft line, warned Moscow of a possible new East-West division that could "massively damage Russia, economically and politically."
Other world powers have been unswayed by Putin's arguments that his seizure of Crimea was needed to protect ethnic Russians from the interim government in Kiev. The new government took over from President Viktor Yanukovych in what the Russians call an illegal coup but which most other countries recognize as legitimate.
"This looked like an old-fashioned land grab from the 18th century" to many governments, said Francois Heisbourg, a former French diplomat who is chairman of the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies. "He's breaking even the rules of the Cold War with this."
China, which usually follows the Russian lead at the United Nations, has been notably silent. The Chinese dislike the precedent of letting ethnic minorities vote for independence, something they have spent years blocking in Tibet and other regions.
Belarus, which hews closely to Russia's line, signaled its ambivalence by recognizing the government in Kiev.
U.S. officials are pushing for a vote in the U.N. Security Council that would provide a vivid illustration of Russia's isolation. The resolution, which condemns the Crimea referendum as illegal, could end up with 12 ayes, a no vote from Russia and a Chinese abstention, Western officials say.
Perhaps most ominous for Russia are signs of an economic pullback.
The most harmful effects "may not be from other governments' sanctions, but from the gradual deterioration of an economic situation that is already weakening," said Blair Ruble, of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.
Russia has long sought to diversify its economy, which now depends heavily on energy. Moscow has hoped to add new centers of technology and innovation. But the Crimea seizure "has left the impression that Russia is an unreliable partner," said Ruble.
Since Putin sent troops into Crimea on Feb. 28, the ruble has hit record lows, the stock market has fallen about 20 percent and many economists have slashed their 2014 growth forecasts.
How real the Western threat of sanctions will be remains to be seen. Broader-gauge sanctions "are still in a discussion stage" within the European Union, said a Western diplomat, speaking anonymously to comment on negotiations.
Merkel, despite her tough language, will remain under pressure from German business and labor groups not to inflict penalties that would harm Germany's economic relationship with Moscow.
But some experts foresee the possibility of a sanctions spiral, perhaps driven by Congress' bipartisan passion for such penalties. Russian officials are warning that they could retaliate by suspending their cooperation on nuclear arms control agreements.
At the same time, Russia's aggressive moves have harmed Moscow's interests elsewhere along its borders, pushing Eastern European members of NATO, including Poland and the Baltic nations of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, to ask for stronger military support from the United States. Countries with large ethnic Russian minorities, including the Baltic states, are especially alarmed.
Some Republican senators are demanding that the Obama administration revive plans for a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic that Russia loathed.
Adding to Moscow's burdens, the moves on Crimea will saddle it with the cost of taking care of the peninsula, an impoverished region that depends on Kiev for water and power. And it has stiffened resistance among most Ukrainians to Russian domination -- which was, all along, Putin's chief goal.

- - - Long Crimea talks fall short
LONDON -- The top U.S. and Russian diplomats failed Friday to avert escalation of the conflict over the Crimean Peninsula, leaving Moscow and Washington badly divided over the legality and consequences of a Sunday referendum on whether Crimea should secede from Ukraine.
Secretary of State John Kerry said Western nations would not recognize the vote and that if the referendum goes forward they would swiftly begin imposing sanctions on Moscow. He also warned that any move by the Russian government or lawmakers to ratify the outcome of the referendum, almost certain to endorse secession, would amount to a "backdoor annexation" of Crimea.
