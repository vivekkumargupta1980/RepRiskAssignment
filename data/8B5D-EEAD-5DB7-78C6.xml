But one part of the past has been hard to escape and it is visible in all the pictures of bananas on the site,which are all Cavendish.United Fruits' history is so dubious it overshadows its remarkable,if debatable,business achievement.Promote Multiple Varieties Bananas grow in warm,moist climates,the fruit needs to ripen to near rottenness for all its starches to turn into delicious sugars and at that point it is very hard to transport without damage.But the company calculated it would work if a variety was found with skin thick enough for transport and it was planted on a large enough scale - hence that endless need for land,with low government involvement,which it found in Central America.They found this in a variety called Gros Michel and a banana empire was born.But this is where nature became a problem.Bananas are propagated from root cuttings,,so they end up as clones of each other.This gives the uniform produce that food industries love,but means plants don't have the resistance that comes from genetic variation.Sure enough,a disease emerged that destroyed Gros Michel.While scientists are trying to come up with an answer,the only solution is to find new places and this is where Golden Bananas come in.Farmers in areas like Gujarat have happily jumped into the gap,growing Cavendish for the global market,and dumping the excess locally.In the end the diseases will attack Indian Cavendish as well and we will be the poorer for having neglected our marvellous array of local bananas in favour of this single,flawed,foreign-promoted variety.But it doesn't have to be that way.The new ChiquitaFyffe's could use its very real organisational and marketing abilities to promote multiple varieties.Refrigerated ships and limate controlled containers mean that India is no longer too far for fruit exports to the West,this might be the time to start promoting our many types of bananas,for all their varied,complex qualities.And once consumers abroad start really to appreciate Indian bananas,perhaps Indian consumers might too!
