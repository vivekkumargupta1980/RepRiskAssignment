After padlocking all the three gates of factory of Jagadamba Group, former chairman of Simara VDC Bhola Adhikari said that the pollution level was unbearable to them.
Adhikari said that they chose to padlock the factory as the pollution caused by the factory started affecting their health. Adhikari further added, "We locals, are irked by pollution caused by the factory and hence decided to padlock it without informing the police administration."
However, sources claimed that the pollution was not the reason behind protest rather locals chose to padlock the factory after the latter refused to donate money for a football match organized by the locals. The factory management had refused to pay Rs 250,000 as demanded by the locals for Ruslan Simara Gold Cup match, said sources.
Adhikari, however, refused the charge levelled against them. However, he conceded that the factory had committed to donate money for the match. The factory employs some 2,500 workers.
Chief District Officer of Bara Dinesh Bhatarai said it is illegal to padlock a factory and warned of action against the locals involved.
Pawan Agrawal, promoter of the factory, complained that they were not given time to reduce pollution levels if that was what the locals had padlocked the factory for.
