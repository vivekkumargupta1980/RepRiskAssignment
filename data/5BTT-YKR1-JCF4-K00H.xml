Deaths in 2012: WHO</title><source>Jiji Press Ticker Service</source><author></author><text><![CDATA[More than seven million people around the world are estimated to have died of diseases caused by air pollution in 2012, a World Health Organization report showed Tuesday.
Of the total, 4.3 million deaths were attributable to so-called household air pollution, such as pollution from cooking and heating with wood and coal, the WHO said.
Meanwhile, 3.7 million deaths are linked to ambient air pollution, including emissions from vehicles and factories.
Both causes are blamed in some cases, the report noted.
Air pollution causes ischemic heart disease and strokes as well as lung cancer and acute lower respiratory disease, the report pointed out.
By region, air pollution is believed to have caused 2.82 million deaths in the western Pacific region including Japan and China, 2.28 million in the Southeast Asian region and 680,000 in Africa.
"Air pollution...is now the biggest environmental health problem and is definitely affecting everyone," Maria Neira, WHO director for public health, environmental and social determinants of health, told a press conference.
On the rapid spread of microparticle PM2.5 in China, another WHO official said that medical masks are not very useful and that gas masks are needed.
