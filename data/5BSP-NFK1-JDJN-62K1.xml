The document indicated security concerns in six of the 12 host cities, including July 13 final venue Rio de Janeiro, where it identified “a difficult relationship between public authorities and society.”Rio authorities are battling to bolster security in the city by increasing police presence in tourist areas while also ramping up a six-year-old policy of “pacifying” the city's sprawling slums.The report also highlighted as a potential problem of a $25-million cut in the military police budget for business hub Sao Paulo, due to host the Cup's opening match.Another concern was Porto Alegre, the scene of a strike by lorry drivers that authorities fear could spread beyond the southern city.Angry Brazilians have taken to the street to protest the $11 billion World Cup price tag, poor public services and government corruption.Although they have been on a smaller scale than last year, when more than a million people took to the streets, some of the demonstrations have ended in violence.The report also expressed concerns over the security of teams and foreign visitors during the month-long Cup, while the government further fears unrest between indigenous groups and agricultural workers in the northeast.But an official in the presidential office said: “The information published in the newspaper is not official and has not been verified.”Copyright CA-NEWS.org, 2014 Provided by Syndigate.info, an Albawaba.com company
