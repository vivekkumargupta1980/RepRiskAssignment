Work has been suspended at 12 sites in the Surat Basin after the deadly fibre was discovered in a product that is used in drilling fluid.
Origin spokesman Phil Craig says the product came from an overseas supplier.
"This is not a CSG-related issue - this is an issue with a product that is used as an additive as part of a process to prepare for CSG gas production," he said.
"We're now working through what does it actually mean.
"We've just been informed that this product contains asbestos, so what we've done is immediately stood down the drill rigs and we have initiated a full investigation.
"Our first priority in that will be the health and safety of our employees."
Western Downs Mayor Ray Brown says he is happy with the company's response but wants to know how the product was allowed into Australia.
"Certainly finding the source of where it's come from - now there's the issue of how did it get into the country in the first place and what other industries have actually utilised it," he said.
Councillor Brown says he is concerned about the wider ramifications of the discovery.
"[It] alludes to another issue - have other industries been utilising this same fluid, whether it's in the water bore industries, anybody that's actually drilling in the earth, have they utilised the same fluid?" he said.
