Just days earlier, masked men opened fire on a busload of military police inside city limits, another rare attack on soldiers so far from the restive Sinai Peninsula, where the army is fighting a counter-insurgency campaign.
Provincial security chief Major General Mahmoud Yousri said the gunmen also planted explosive devices after yesterday's attack in Shubra al-Kheima, but bomb disposal experts managed to diffuse two and detonate another in a controlled explosion.
The military blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for the attack, calling the group "terrorists" and saying they had planted the additional bombs to target rescue workers rushing to the scene.
Armed Forces Spokesman Colonel Ahmed Mohammed Ali said the soldiers, of a military police unit, were attacked just after morning prayers.
"These cowardly operations will only increase our determination to continue the war against terrorism," Ali said.Egyptian authorities say the Brotherhood has orchestrated a series of bomb attacks on police and other targets following the overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi, who hails from the Islamist group.
