The charges stem from work carried out by the company in 2010 on a rail line adjacent to Cougar Creek that supports chum and coho salmon, and other fish species.
The Honourable Judge John Lenaghan ordered the Railway Company to pay a penalty of $70,000 to the Environmental Damages Fund toward the proper management and control of fisheries and fish habitat, and the conservation and protection of fish or fish habitat, in the Cougar Creek watershed located in Surrey and Delta, B.C. The conviction also includes an additional $5,000 fine.
Quick Facts
/T/
-- Work done by the Railway Company between October 30 and November 9, 2010 to maintain the rail line resulted in the harmful alteration, disruption, and destruction of fish habitat. -- BNSF's environmental consultants provided Fisheries and Oceans Canada with the proposed work plan; however, the Railway Company did not follow this. The work did not remain within the pre-determined area, was not completed within the appropriate timeframe when fish were not present, modified the local vegetation, and involved more than double the volume of rip rap rock to control erosion than was outlined in the work plan. -- Cougar Creek provides fish habitat for several fish species including coho and chum salmon and cutthroat trout. Cutthroat trout have been observed in portions of Cougar Creek and spend their whole life cycle there. Both chum and coho salmon spawn in portions of Cougar Creek; coho salmon spend approximately one year rearing in portions of the Creek before migrating to the marine environment. -- The fines were ordered paid in full by March 31, 2014.
