It developed as a residential hub at the turn of the 20th century, mostly due to the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company (JCI) which was founded in 1889 by Barney Barnato, a British entrepreneur.
JCI was a major force in mining for over 100 years. It owned large industrial and property holdings, including the Houghton Estate in northern Joburg.
Houghton has traditionally been informally divided into two areas, Upper Houghton and Lower Houghton.
Upper Houghton is the hilly southern portion located on a ridge, while the northern Lower Houghton is flatter, and has a grid street pattern, with portions lying on both sides of the M1 freeway.
Upper and Lower Houghton are separated by the east-west section of Houghton Drive.
Smaller sections of Upper Houghton lie east of Louis Botha Avenue (bordering Observatory), and west of the north-south section of Houghton Drive (bordering Parktown and Hillbrow).
Upper Houghton has been declared a National Heritage Area.
As a historically wealthy area, the suburb consists of numerous lavish upper-class homes, along with a few blocks of flats and office parks.
The suburb is architecturally varied with good examples of Art Deco buildings, particularly evident in some of the blocks of flats.
The most famous resident of Houghton was Nelson Mandela.

The number of reported burglaries at non-residential premises remained the same at 76. Burglaries at residential premises showed a slight decrease from 320 to 308. Theft of motor vehicles and motorcycles increased slightly from 201 to 206. Theft out or from cars however, increased from 306 to 356.
RE/MAX
Adrian Goslett, chief executive of RE/MAX of southern Africa, says property in Houghton consists mostly of freestanding homes, with some sectional title units and estates to a lesser extent. He says from 2004 to 2006, property prices in the area saw a steady but marginal increase. From 2007 until 2009 prices rose by much greater increments.
"Prices dipped slightly in 2010, but recovered in 2011 with the price of a freestanding home hitting a record high of R4.6 million. The average price of a sectional title unit was about R900 000 at the time," he said.
In 2012, prices saw another dip, with the average price of a freestanding home dropping to R4.1m and a sectional title unit costing about R894 000. "Although freestanding home prices have remained stable so far, the average price of a sectional title unit has seen an increase and is currently R1.1m," he said.
Goslett said the demographics of recent buyers in Houghton was evenly distributed between the age groups. The majority of buyers were between 50 and 64 years old, then 36 and 49 years old. A smaller percentage was under the age of 35.
"Currently the highest number of homeowners in the suburb is those between the ages of 36 and 49 years old," he said.
Goslett said while the majority of the sales in the area from 2004 to 2007 were freestanding properties, sectional title units became more popular during 2008 and had outsold freestanding homes since. Contact RE/MAX at 011 274 '8
SOTHEBY'S INTERNATIONAL
Lew Geffen, chairman of Sotheby's International Realty in South Africa said his advice to property investors right now was: buy as much land as you can in the best areas you can - almost irrespective of the condition of the buildings on the property - because substantial land parcels in sought-after areas are set to become increasingly rare.
There are at least two factors working in concert that will boost the value of properties and the potential returns from them over the next few years in Houghton, said Geffen.
"In the first place, the new spatial plans for our large cities lean heavily towards densification and better use of their land and resources to accommodate the rapid urbanisation of our population. And this predisposes city councils to the subdivision - albeit within limits - of the very large stands that are still fairly common in such affluent suburbs as Houghton.
"Secondly, steep increases in property rates and maintenance costs over the past few years, as well as security concerns, are prompting many wealthy homeowners to consider modern clusters or high-end sectional title homes as alternatives to the large houses they have traditionally favoured.
"Meanwhile those fortunate enough to already own large stands in the heritage suburbs should seriously investigate the possibility of subdividing them and developing them to accommodate three or four homes - one for their own use, perhaps, and the others for sale or to let."

Q and A with Houghton (Ward 73) councillor, Marcelle Ravid
Q: Are there any pressing service and infrastructure problems in the area?
A: Ageing infrastructure like water pipes, electricity cables and roads. Joburg Water fixes them in one spot then they burst a few meters down the road. Excavations can remain open for months. There is a considerable upgrade taking place at the local substation on Atholl-Oaklands Road. Hopefully this will alleviate some of the problems.
Q: Are the roads in a good state? Is the water and electricity supply reliable?
A: Some roads are in a very bad state. There will be resurfacing of a few streets in Houghton in this financial year. Pavements are in an appalling state. Reinstatements are not properly monitored by the Joburg Road Agency, and many companies do not complete a job. I have to keep eagle eyes out for contractors and make sure I have their contact details for follow-ups.
I've noticed on two occasions recently that City Power has objected to applications for rezoning in Houghton. They are worried about capacity. Five years ago, they objected to the Houghton Golf Course development for that reason, then miraculously withdrew the objection just before the hearing.
Q: Does the area have problems with, for example, illegal buildings?
A: Yes, there are many. The council's planning department has a backlog of plans to pass. Apparently the problem of obtaining clearance certificates for properties sold is still an enormous obstacle to the completion of transfers.
Q: Are you happy with the mayor's pledge to fix northern suburbs' roads?
A: His pledge is welcome but a drop in the ocean. And where will the budget come from? C
Q: What do you think would attract residents and businesses and what about the area is unattractive?
A: Houghton is still a desirable address. The Gautrain has influenced planning so Oxford Road is now allowed high, mixed-use densities. The heritage area of Upper Houghton will safeguard the heritage houses there. This needs to be done in Lower Houghton as well.
If maintenance was done systematically and the basics were looked after, the area would be far more attractive.
Q: What issues/complaints have you as a councillor had to deal with?
A: Incorrect billing and valuations. The sudden billing of second stands or double billing for rates. I managed to get a ruling that if one has proof in one's title deeds that two or more stands are notarially tied, the second stand must be zero-rated. Many people have been double billed since July when the new rates took effect. If there is no proof of notarially tied stands, the council recently decided to charge rates on the other stands as "vacant land", which is charged at a higher rate.
Other issues include sloppy by-law enforcement, illegal businesses, signage, noise pollution, dumping, drinking in public, shebeens, overcrowding of properties, deterioration of unoccupied properties, hawking and illegal parking.
Q: Is crime an issue?
A: Crime could have been a bigger issue but for the private security companies that patrol the streets 24 hours a day. In the Orange Grove section, however, it's very high.
