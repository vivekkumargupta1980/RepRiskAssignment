A statement issued by TKM read, "under the instigation of the union, certain sections of the employees have resorted to deliberate stoppages of the production line, abuse and threatening of supervisors thereby continuously disrupting business for the past 25 days."
The company said that it was left with no other option but to declare a lockout of the premises to ensure the safety of its workers and management personnel.
For the past 10 months the Toyota management and the company's labour union have been discussing a charter of demands, mostly related to wage issues, for the ongoing financial year ending March 31.
"As bipartite agreement was not reached the labor department of the government of Karnataka conducted seven tripartite meetings in order to reach a settlement. The conciliation efforts of the labor department have not yet resulted in an agreement," said Toyota.
Toyota, which has market leadership in the MPV segment with its Innova, has two manufacturing facilities in Bidadi that have a combined annual production capacity of 3.10 lakh units. Toyota Motor Corporation has 89% equity stake in TKM with the remaining 11% held by the Kirloskar group.
In the recent past Bangalore's automotive industry has been plagued by union unrest, forcing companies to halt their manufacturing for brief periods. Bosch, a leading global manufacturer of automotive components and systems, has faced at least four 'tool down' strikes by its labour union in the last four years.
