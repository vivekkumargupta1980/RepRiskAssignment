The office has voiced its position in an address to the management of the enterprise, the press service of the ombudsman has reported.
"In the address, it draws attention to reports, which are being systematically circulated in the media, about the unsettled labour relations at the enterprise till this moment and discussions about staff reduction," the report circulated says.
The office of the ombudsman mentions that a special working group visited the ArcelorMittal Temirtau joint-stock company in 2013 and revealed violations of the labour rights of the workers.
