Origin Energy last week announced the suspension of its CSG operations in the Surat Basin after learning an imported chemical used in its drilling fluid contained asbestos.
Supplier Australian Mud Company has withdrawn Nutplug a walnut shell-based product used to seal wells from sale and is investigating how the contamination occurred.
Origin, which owns a 37.5 per cent stake in the massive Australia Pacific Liquified Natural Gas Project, is yet to determine the extent of the scare.
But in a statement to The Leader, a Satos spokeswoman said the company did not use the product in its exploration activities in the Pilliga.
"Satos has examined its supply chain and can confirm that it is not using the Nutplug product," she said.
"As always, the safety of our employees, contractors and community members is our top priority."
Origin's asbestos scare rounded out a horror week for Australia's controversial coal seam gas industry.
Just days earlier it emerged Satos had been fined $1500 after a storage pond in the Pilliga leaked toxic water ito an aquifer.
