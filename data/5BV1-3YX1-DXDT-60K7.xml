The 'Big Six' energy has said a freeze at current prices would hit profits but it will cut 500 jobs and shelve plans to develop three offshore windfalls to save £100 million and make up for the freeze investment.
The move follows a backlash against the 'big six' energy firms - SSE, Scottish Power, Centrica, RWE npower, E.ON and EDF Energy - after prices were raised across the market last year.
SSE's pledge will provide a fillip for Labour leader Ed Miliband who accused the energy giants of overcharging customers and promised to freeze prices if elected in 2015.
The companies have denied the allegations but Britain's Secretary of State for Energy Ed Davey last month called on the authorities to consider breaking up energy companies if they were found to be abusing monopoly positions.
The Labour party has called for a restructuring of the energy market whereby utilities should separate their retail and generation businesses. SSE has opted to separate its wholesale and retail divisions.
In a detailed update, SSE also said it would sell assets and businesses to raise £1 billion to reduce debt.
It forecast capital investments of £1.6 billion in 2014/15, above analyst estimates
