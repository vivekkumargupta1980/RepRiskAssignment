The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says in a statement Wednesday the lawsuit settlement with Oklahoma City-based LSB Industries requires the company and four of its subsidiaries to reduce nitrogen dioxide emissions by more than 800 tons annually. The plants will invest up to $11.7 million in the facilities to implement the emission cuts.
Nitrogen dioxide contributes to ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution and has been associated with causing respiratory ailments.
LSB and its subsidiaries will also pay a penalty of $725,000 to resolve violations of the federal Clean Air Act and Oklahoma environmental laws.
The settlement applies to 10 plants in Arkansas, Alabama, Oklahoma and Texas.
