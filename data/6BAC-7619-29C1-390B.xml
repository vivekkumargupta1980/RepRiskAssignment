Maryann Bowman, CEO and owner of the auto body repair business, said State Farm's Select Service Program requires her to buy parts through a "middle man" as opposed to getting them directly from trusted vendors.
Bowman will continue to service customers with State Farm insurance, but her decision means State Farm may stop referring its customers to her shop.
In a statement, State Farm said: "Shops are free to apply for entry into our program and are free to leave our program at any time. We understand that each shop is going to make the decision that it feels is best for its business." State Farm has been rolling out the program incrementally and just recently implemented it in New York. It has been controversial in other states. In Mississippi, for instance, body shops have gone to court to challenge the program.
In Florida, a group of repair shops filed an antitrust lawsuit against State Farm and other insurers.
