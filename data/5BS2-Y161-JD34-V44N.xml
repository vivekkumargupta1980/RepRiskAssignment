While the royal commission Governor-General Quentin Bryce formally established last week singles out groups such as the building union the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Engineering Union for scrutiny, it will also shine a light on the role of companies, given its remit to investigate "any bribe, secret commission or other unlawful payment ... between an employee association ... and any other party". It raises the question whether companies seen to have engaged in this behaviour will be regarded as victims or as co-conspirators who are just as guilty as those perpetrating the extortion.
"There have been allegations of corrupt conduct by companies in the industry over the years," said former Australian Building and Construction Commissioner John Lloyd on Monday.
CFMEU national secretary Dave Noonan said the government, through the commission, would be more focused on damaging the union movement, rather than chasing companies.
"There may be some collateral casualties among companies where that's found to be convenient," he said.
The Master Builders Association will likely seek to highlight the context of intimidation employers face.
"Criticisms of employers agreeing to excessive and unreasonable building union demands around wages and conditions will be made but Master Builders will emphasise the stand-over tactics and the financial and industrial gun that building unions hold to the heads of construction firms," it said last month.
