Water executive Barack Abonyo said local industries discharge raw effluents directly into the lake posing health risk to the public. He said the trend is worrying and called for immediate action by environmental stakeholders.
Abonyo said cases of water-borne diseases are on the rise due to effluent discharged into water sources. He said the county government has put in place stringent measures to curb lake pollution.
Abonyo said car wash operators have been directed to use designated areas and stop washing vehicles in the lake and rivers. Environment executive Rhoda Ahonobadha said a new environment bill will be passed to address the solid waste and pollution management.
She said the county government is set to come up with a policy on waste management to fight pollution. Ahonobadha said the law will ensure residents and all the institutions observe set environmental health standards.
They were speaking during the launch of river cleaning campaign at Kisat River in Kisumu yesterday. She called for effective use of natural resources to the benefit of the entire East African region. They said the lake's waters has been contaminated.
