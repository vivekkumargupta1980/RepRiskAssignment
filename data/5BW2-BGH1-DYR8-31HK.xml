The deal, signed on Friday between Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and World Bank Climate Investment director Pierre Guislain, aims at transforming Mombasa to match the leading world class business hubs.
The UK government through DFID and the Dutch Government is funding the project to a tune of Sh104 million. The KICP II project will help create new business environments, reduce cost of doing business and attract more private investments in the region.
Speaking during the signing ceremony of the agreement at Whitesands hotel, Joho said the project will automate all services offered by the county government. He said it will enhance service and help curb corruption at the county offices.
"We are now walking in the right direction where Mombasa will become a corruption free-zone and offer quality services to all the residents and investors," Joho said. He said Mombasa had been the economic hub of the region, but due to archaic legislations and poor policy directions over the years, it lost its luster as the center of commerce.
