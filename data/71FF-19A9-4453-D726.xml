McCormac announced that the 2014 Woodbridge Township Have-A-Heart food drive collected more than 20,000 pounds of non-perishable food and netted more than $33,200 in cash donations to support the efforts of local food pantries in their work to aid needy families throughout the township.
More than 100 township corporations, businesses, retail outlets, school students, charitable organizations and residents contributed to the 2014 "Have-A-Heart" food drive.
"The Have-A-Heart food drive is one of the most important programs that we as a community participate in each January and February. I am proud to be part of the effort to extend the generosity of the holiday season and to replenish and restock township food banks," McCormac said.
Nonperishable foods can be dropped off weekdays from 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Woodbridge Township Public Health Center, 2 George Frederick Plaza.
Other food drop-off locations are at Woodbridge Town Hall, the Woodbridge Library or the Woodbridge Community Center.
