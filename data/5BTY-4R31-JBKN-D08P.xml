("Envivio" or the "Company") in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint was filed on behalf of persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Envivio securities (Nasdaq:ENVI) between April 25, 2012 and September 6, 2012 and seeks remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Investors who purchased Envivio securities during the Class Period and wish to serve as a lead plaintiff in the class action must move the Court no later than April 29, 2014. Members of the investor class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain absent class members in the lawsuit.
