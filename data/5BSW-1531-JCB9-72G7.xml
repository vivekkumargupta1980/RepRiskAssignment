Paulo Roberto Costa, Petrobras' refining chief under former CEO José Sergio Gabrielli de Azevedo, was arrested as part of the Lava Jato federal police operation, state-run news service Agência Brasil said Thursday.
He was arrested in Rio de Janeiro for destroying evidence and given a provisional five-day jail term.
The operation has so far led to 24 arrests in 17 cities, with suspects accused of being involved in a US$4bn laundering scheme, according to police.
Police said Costa's arrest is not linked to investigations about Petrobras' controversial purchase of the Pasadena oil refinery in 2006, revealed this week.
A Petrobras spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.
