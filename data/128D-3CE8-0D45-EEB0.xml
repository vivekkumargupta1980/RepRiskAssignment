It means that the 83-year-old was not in Australia for today's season-opener. Instead, he is in London preparing his defence for his trial in Munich next month. German prosecutors say the payment from Ecclestone and his Bambino family trust to Gerhard Gribkowsky, former chief risk officer at German bank BAYERNLB, was a bribe.
Gribkowsky was responsible for selling BAYERNLB's 47.2 per cent stake in F1 in 2006 and German prosecutors believe he was bribed to sell the sport to private equity investment group CVC, which had agreed to retain Ecclestone as F1's chief executive. Ecclestone said: "I regret paying him."
He denies paying a bribe and claims that Gribkowsky threatened to tell HM Revenue & Customs that he controlled the offshore Bambino Trust, if the $44 million was not paid. As Ecclestone is a UK resident he would be liable to pay tax on the $4 billion (£2.4 billion) trust. He says he paid Gribkowsky even though the allegation was false to avoid a lengthy and costly HMRC investigation.
He said: "I should have let him write to the Revenue and let them prove what he said. It is a wonderful thing, hindsight."
