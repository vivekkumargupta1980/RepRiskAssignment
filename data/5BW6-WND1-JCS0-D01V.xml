According to Reuters news agency, Mr Scaroni was jailed for three years and also been banned from holding public office for five years.
The court hearing, held in the north-eastern town of Rovigo, related to the violation or breaches of environmental standards at the Porto Tolle power plant in northern Italy in a period when Mr Scaroni was running Enel, Italy's largest utility business.
Mr Scaroni, who is under investigation over corruption charges in Algeria involving 43 per centowned oil services group Saipem, has been at the helm of state-controlled Eni since 2005.
The chief executive of utility Enel, Fulvio Conti, was reported to have been acquitted in the same case.
Mr Scaroni issued a statement and said he was shocked by the decision. He said: "I am in no way involved in this matter and will appeal immediately."
Scaroni has already served three terms as chief executive at Eni and his current mandate will expire in May. The sentence will mean he is unlikely to be able to continue in his role at Eni.
The Italian government wants state-controlled companies to eject from their boards any director charged of financial crimes, in a drive to fight corruption and improve corporate accountability.
