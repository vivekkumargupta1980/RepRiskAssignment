Addressing the protest gathering, Vice-Chairman of the ANNISU-Revolutionary, Jagrit Rayamajhi, demanded immediate roll back of the petroleum price hike .
As per the revised rate, petrol will now cost Rs. 140 per litre, and diesel and kerosene Rs 109 per litre each. However, there was no change in the price of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).
Currently, the NOC has been incurring a loss of Rs. 169.7 million per month. With this price adjustment, the NOC's losses would be reduced to 102 million rupees a month, said Officiating Executive Director, Sagar Satyal.
