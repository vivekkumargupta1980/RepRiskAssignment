A summon was sent late in the evening asking him to visit STF office on Thursday, said sources. Sharma is has been summoned for the second time.
Earlier, he was questioned for more than two hours and let off following lack of corroborative evidences against him. This time, STF has secured incriminating documents and are likely to even arrest him, said sources.
Sharma was allegedly in touch with some of the key accused in the scam. He had given a list of six candidates to PEB officials to manipulate their results for food inspectors and contractual teachers' recruitment examinations. "He will be questioned on revelations made by other accused in the case," said an STF officer.
Recently, income tax department had asked Enforcement Directorate (ED) to probe, whether Sharma, who reportedly has access to those who matter in the ruling government, is involved in any overseas operations. I-T department officials came across an email sent by an ex-employee of Sharma's SR Group, which mentioned visits to Indonesia and mining operations in Jakarta. The copy of the email has been forwarded to the ED headquarters in New Delhi, sources said.
Sharma is currently under scanner of two anti-corruption agencies - Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and state Lokayukta- for alleged payoffs to government officials. The inquiries were initiated on the basis of inputs shared by I-T department.
