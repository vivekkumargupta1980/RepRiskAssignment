Wang Qishan, secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), made the comments while announcing a new round of inspections to be carried out at 11 provincial-level governments, two institutes and a massive State-owned enterprise. It will be the third round of sweeps since last May. Inspectors will go to Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, Fujian, Shandong, Henan, Hainan, Gansu, Ningxia and Xinjiang, and to the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a semi-military development organization in the remote far western region. Special “investigation projects” also will be conducted at the Ministry of Science and Technology, Shanghai-based Fudan University and State-owned China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corp. Wang asked inspectors to work with a “sober mind,” as situations related to the anti-corruption fight remained “grave and complicated.” He also warned that inspectors who turned a blind eye to violations would be held accountable. Discipline inspectors conducted 155,000 investigations last year that were based on tips from the public, resulting in prosecutions of more than 160,000 officials in government and State enterprises, Wang said.
