The Pink Floyd star hit back in an open letter after he was taunted for urging a boycott of Israel over its policies towards Palestinians.
Jewish tycoon Gerald Ronson last week claimed the musician "insists he is only anti-Israel - and isn't, of course, anti-Semitic".
The implied slur drove Waters, 70, to write: "My father, the son of a coal miner, taught divinity, history and English in Jerusalem and died in Italy in 1944, fighting the Nazi menace. Do not presume to preach to me about anti-Semitism or human rights.
"I am not an anti-Semite or against the Israeli people. I am a critic of the policies of the government of Israel."
A rabbi accused him of inciting hatred after he released an inflatable pig bearing a Jewish Star of David at a Belgian gig last year. Pigs are considered unclean in Judaism.
He also blasted Scarlett Johansson for her association with SodaStream, an Isreali firm with a controversial West Bank plant.
Waters' father Eric was killed at Anzio. He unveiled a monument to his memory last month.
