Speaking to media persons here today, AITUC general secretary Christopher Fonseca said that they have planned to organise the mass rally in the city to express the mining workers stiff opposition to all forms of unfair labour practices by the employers.
In the meanwhile, public meetings will be organized in all the mining areas to highlight the ongoing mining crisis and the abiding threat to livelihoods of the people of Goa, he said and called upon Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar to address all the issues in fair and proper manner instead of making announcements in the run-up to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.
Mr Fonseca alleged that BJP government in Goa was not serious about re-starting mining in the state. He also alleged that government was hoodwinking the mining stake- holders under the garb of announcing new schemes.
He accused government of not making any efforts to stop retrenchement of workers employed on various mines, and said companies like Sesa Goa and Sesa Sterlite have already challenged the order of Central government denying permission to lay off 150 workers in Delhi High Court.
