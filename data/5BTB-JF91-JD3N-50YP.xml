Sydney Water had agreed to pay the expenses of AWH for infrastructure and costs associated with a North-West Growth Centre project.
But the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) inquiry was told yesterday that the state government agency had become concerned about the exorbitant expenses.
Senior Sydney Water official Ron Quill told ICAC the agency was "stonewalled" by AWH during attempts to get a breakdown of costs after an approved budget blew out by $6.5 million between July 2007 and May 2008.
"Without any justification we couldn't agree to pay these costs," Mr Quill said. "Obviously I thought they were hiding something. They refused to provide information." When he said it appeared the directors were demanding money to which they were not entitled, Geoffrey Watson, SC, assisting the inquiry, said his words appeared to be a polite interpretation for "fraud".
Mr Quill wound up being wrongly accused of corruption after his stand against AWH.
The corruption watchdog is examining AWH and its dealings with figures on both sides of politics as it tried to win lucrative government contracts.
The ICAC has heard that Mr Sinodinos was brought into the company and offered a -potential $20 million windfall because of his links to the Liberal Party. He was the party's NSW treasurer at the time.Mr Sinodinos stood aside as Federal Assistant Treasurer this week to await the outcome of the corruption inquiry.
