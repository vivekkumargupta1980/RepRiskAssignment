An actress is suing the BBC for up to £1million after Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson allegedly made a racist remark during the series finale.
Indian-born Somi Guha, 36, has instructed lawyers after Clarkson used the word 'slope' - a derogatory term for people of Asian descent - in the Top Gear Burma special.
Ms Guha claims that broadcasting Clarkson's comment amounts to unlawful discrimination by a public body.
Her lawyers, Equal Justice, claim her action could cost the BBC £1 million in punitive damages under equality laws unless it apologises and takes the hit motoring show off the air.
They say she is one of a group of people who were offended by the term - and so sought legal advice from the firm, who previously worked on racism allegations surrounding reality show Celebrity Big Brother.
A BBC spokeswoman for Top Gear said the Corporation had no comment on Miss Guha's action.
In the series finale, the three hosts - Richard Hammond, James May and Jeremy Clarkson - are tasked with building a bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand.
After completion, Clarkson, 53, said: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it', as a man walked towards him on a makeshift bridge.
Co-presenter Richard Hammond, 44, replied: 'You're right, it's definitely higher on that side.'
At the time, viewers were left outraged by the 'slope' reference, described by Twitter users as 'not big, not clever, not funny' and 'a gag too far'.
Miss Guha, of Tower Hamlets, east London, starred in 2006 sci-fi movie Children of Men and has also appeared in hit ITV show The Bill.
In her formal written complaint to the BBC, she says: 'Casual racism in the media by established BBC stalwarts is constantly brushed aside.
'Discrimination within the industry is accepted. Racial profiling of roles is accepted and expected.
'I find it offensive that Jeremy Clarkson refers to people of different races in pejorative terms.
'What is that saying to children who watch him? - that it's OK to bully and make racist comments
'Jeremy Clarkson has made derogatory comments about Mexicans. Now he bullies an Asian person. It has to stop.'
The next step for Miss Guha would be to apply to a county court under the Equality Act.
Equal Justice, a firm specialising in discrimination cases, is demanding that the BBC investigates Clarkson's comment.
In a letter to BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten on Miss Guha's behalf, it writes of Clarkson: 'He and the show must be censured to ensure that another race or nation is not targeted.
'It was the BBC's failure to effectively sanction him about the racism against Mexican people that allows him to have the confidence to now attack people of Asian descent. He believes himself to be unaccountable.
'It is clear gross misconduct on his part and would be in any modern British workplace.
'Please process this complaint as a matter of urgency and give due consideration to not recommissioning Top Gear for another series until these matters are addressed.'
Equal Justice's Lawrence Davies said today: 'The BBC refuses to tackle serial offender Jeremy Clarkson.
'The BBC defends his behaviour as British humour but it is offensive, casual racism being used to boost ratings. It is shameful and makes the BBC appear to be institutionally racist.'
Mr Davies previously worked on racism allegations surrounding Celebrity Big Brother - which at that time was shown on Channel 4.
The controversy centred on comments made  late Jade Goody, glamour model Danielle Lloyd, and singer Jo O'Meara, which were directed towards Indian actress Shilpa Shetty.
Equal Justice previously represented Mexican student Iris de la Torre when she accused Clarkson and Hammond of bigoted comments about her countrymen.
Hammond branded Mexicans 'lazy, feckless and flatulent' while Clarkson claimed its ambassador to the UK would not complain because he would be snoring in front of his embassy TV.

In 2008, the show was rapped by the BBC Trust for showing Clarkson and fellow presenter James May sipping gin and tonic at the wheel during a stunt.
During a press conference in Australia in February 2009, Clarkson branded then Prime Minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'
Earlier this year, Clarkson was forced to apologise for posting a picture of himself asleep on a plane, with a sign with the words 'gay c**t' written on it, and an arrow pointed at himself.
In 2011, Hammond was discussing a Mexican sports car and suggested that vehicles reflect the national characteristics of the country they are from.
He said: 'Mexican cars are just going to be lazy, feckless, flatulent, leaning against a fence asleep looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat.'
The Mexican ambassador Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza did make a formal complaint to the BBC and called on the presenters to make a public apology for stirring 'bigoted feelings against the Mexican people'.

Miss de la Torre took legal action against Top Gear but did not pursue it any further after receiving an apology from the BBC.
Clarkson and Top Gear, with their blend of motoring news, schoolboy humour and audacious stunts, are no strangers to controversy.
