That policy leaves us in this situation of energy supplies over which we have no control and at the mercy of foreign energy moguls and possibly hostile regimes who could use energy as a weapon.
We should be exploring renewable energy sos urces with more investment to free us from dependence on outside forces, perhaps even fracking.
Unless, of course, our politicians sell it all off to foreis gn energy moguls so they can sell it back to us at inflated prices, claiming market forces etc.
