The claimants, hailing from Japan and 32 other countries including the United States, Germany and South Korea, want the US and Japanese nuclear power plant suppliers to pay compensation, lawyer Akihiro Shima told media in Tokyo.
The filing was described by Shima as the first lawsuit to be brought against nuclear power suppliers over the 2011 accident.
It alleges that the firms did not make necessary safety updates to the stricken site, which was swamped by an earthquake-sparked tsunami.
Under Japanese law, nuclear plant suppliers are usually exempt from damage claims in the event of an accident. #124â€“ AFP
@HD2 New Briefs head;Obama takes satirical hit to #124his chin to sell healthcare
@BT New Screen/briefs Text - no indent;US President Barack Obama is trying a new strategy in his struggle to sell his stumbling healthcare law â€¦ self #124parody.
Obama ventured onto the spoof online comedy show "Between Two Ferns" in which host and "Hangover" star Zach Galifianakis grills showbiz luminaries with embarrassing questions.
"What's it like to be the last black president," Galifianakis asked Obama in the show, which debuted on the "Funny or Die" website on Tuesday.
"What's it like for this to be the last time you ever talk to a president," Obama hit back.
Galifianakis, spoofing low budget television interview shows, also jabbed Obama over "ambassador" Dennis Rodman's trips to North Korea and ribbed him over his "home country" of Kenya. For the president, the point of the exercise was to reach a youthful audience since the healthcare law depends on healthy, young Americans to sign up to subsidise care for the sick and elderly. â€“ AFP

@BT New Screen/briefs Text - no indent;From streetwalkers who charge as little as $5 (Bt161) per sex act to pimps who bring in tens of thousands a week, prostitution is big business in the United States a study released on Wednesday found.
The Urban Institute is the first research group to come up with a solid estimate on how much money changes hands and how the market for sex works in eight US cities.
In the tourism and convention hub of Atlanta, Georgia, the underground sex economy was pegged at $290 million a year, more than the illicit sale of drugs and guns combined.
Police described their struggles infiltrating brothels, massage parlours and topless bars that cater to specific ethnicities, Latino, Asian or Russian and Eastern European men, and are often run by organised crime rings. â€“ AFP
